<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Next summer SIT Graduate Institute will launch the Inclusive Security: International Policy and Practice Certificate program to train professionals to lead innovative and more sustainable approaches to peacebuilding. SIT is offering the program in partnership with the Institute for Inclusive Security with the goal of developing a network of inclusive and human security practitioners who can bridge institutional and international differences. Inclusive security seeks to increase participation of all stakeholders, especially women, in the prevention and resolution of violent conflicts.</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">“When women are included, they contribute innovative perspectives, bridge divides between warring groups, and enhance the legitimacy of the process, thus increasing the likelihood that peace will last.” — Donald Steinberg</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">SIT received a $100,000 grant from Hunt Alternatives, the Institute for Inclusive Security’s parent organization, to develop the program. The curriculum will build on the expertise of SIT and The Institute for Inclusive Security in the social change arena to develop participants’ skills and professional capacity.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“There is a vital need in the foreign affairs sphere to enable policy makers and practitioners alike to better understand this broader security paradigm,” said Ambassador Swanee Hunt, founder and president of Hunt Alternatives.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The nine-credit certificate program will be tailored for early- and mid-career professionals in the field of security policy and peacemaking. It will highlight the agency of women as active and critical participants in shaping peace and security and equip students to challenge and reform existing security practices using the theory, language, and best practices in the field. It is designed to be completed in three consecutive semesters over a one-year period. SIT plans to make this part of a stackable certificate degree program so that students will have an opportunity to move on to earn a master’s degree.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“World Learning is proud to partner with the Institute for Inclusive Security to implement this groundbreaking program,” said World Learning President and CEO Donald Steinberg. “When women are included, they contribute innovative perspectives, bridge divides between warring groups, and enhance the legitimacy of the process, thus increasing the likelihood that peace will last.”</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">SIT Graduate Institute Professor and Director of Conflict Transformation Across Cultures (CONTACT), Paula Green, retired in June. As a Professor of Conflict Transformation, Green had extensive international experience in peacebuilding and conflict transformation and has worked as an international consultant, facilitator and lecturer in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Colleagues say she brought a keen sense of social responsibility and spiritual awareness to her work as a psychologist, educator and leader in the field of peacebuilding.</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">"The legacy Paula left for us is thousands of peacebuilders who emerged, bonded, and began to work together in some of the world’s most difficult conflict-affected societies." — Tatsushi Arai</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“The innovative nature of Paula’s work was most evident when she initiated CONTACT South Asia program in 2010,” said Tatsushi Arai, SIT professor of Peacebuilding and Conflict Transformation. “This reflected the reality of the deepening conflicts in South Asia, many years of her extensive on the ground work in the region, as well as the growing difficulty on the part of South Asia’s Muslim majority societies to be able to send participants to CONTACT’s Brattleboro, Vermont summer program.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Green founded CONTACT in 1997 as a graduate certificate program of the SIT Summer Peacebuilding Institute. The program gathers peacemakers from around the world annually in June on SIT’s Brattleboro, Vermont, campus and in South Asia in December. CONTACT has close to 1,000 alumni from more than 80 countries around the world today.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“The legacy Paula left for us is thousands of peacebuilders who emerged, bonded, and began to work together in some of the world’s most difficult conflict-affected societies,” Arai said. “Paula’s legacy also includes the viability of citizen-led networking and capacity-building for peace that is capable of initiating and sustaining a people’s peace.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In 2008, Green was honored for her lifelong contribution to conflict transformation and peacebuilding by Wisdom in Action, a California based nonprofit, and was presented the honorary award by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Bruce Dayton, CONTACT’s new director, comes to SIT with more than 20 years of experience in peacebuilding and conflict transformation. Most recently, he was a member of faculty at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. He also serves as associate director at the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs and research co-director of the Intra and Inter-State Conflicts Research Initiative at the Program for the Advancement of Research on Conflict and Collaboration at the school.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Dayton will continue the work of the program, focusing on conflict transformation — as opposed to resolution — as the best hope of tackling serious conflicts around the world. In a recent lecture at SIT, he explained, “the most we can do is to try to make conflict constructive instead of destructive.” One way to do that, Dayton said, is to change the narrative: “Change the story, and you change the conflict.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In honor of Paula’s years of service to the CONTACT program, the Paula Green Peace Leaders Scholarship Fund for CONTACT was established this past spring. All donations to this fund go exclusively towards assisting future CONTACT participants. Gifts can be made to this fund at <a href="http://www.sit.edu/graduate/donatenow" target="_blank">sit.edu/graduate/donatenow</a>.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Judith Brown Meyers, PhD, is passionate about World Learning’s international development work, and is a champion of the Institute for Political and Civic Engagement (iPACE) program in Burma, which trains local civil society leaders and activists to effectively take part in their burgeoning democracy.
A World Learning board member from 2011 to 2014, Meyers, who lives in Rye, New Hampshire, has had an illustrious career in international development with a primary focus on South Asia and environmental issues.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Meyers joined the World Learning family after meeting board member Mary Davidson on a trip to Bhutan with a group of friends. Davidson knew of her academic background and experience in international affairs and encouraged Meyers to learn more about the organization. Meyers joined the board soon after and has been actively involved in World Learning ever since.</p>               
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I know the various players out there and I know that World Learning’s development work is stellar,” she said. “Their ethics, their approach, the way that they work with their counterparts in each of the countries in which they have contracts.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Meyers supports scholarships for iPACE, which offset the costs of transportation and lodging for participants, and ensure that iPACE students from throughout the country can attend the program in Mandalay or Yangon. These scholarships underscore iPACE’s dedication to pluralism and creating a student base that reflects the diversity of the country.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">After visiting iPACE in March 2015, Meyers noted the range of participants. “It wasn’t just twenty-somethings,” she said. “There was a man who had been a political dissident who had just been released from prison. There were people representing various political parties; there were people representing a variety of ethnic minorities, women’s organizations, and labor organizations.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Meyers recalled a conversation with iPACE director Adam LeClair, who relayed to her an example of the scholarship’s impact. “There was a program in which there were two deaf people, and Adam used a scholarship to hire a sign language interpreter [to assist the participants] who otherwise wouldn’t be able to attend.” She saw iPACE putting into action the “importance of developing civil societies throughout the whole country, especially people who are marginalized and underserved because of geography and economics.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I loved that so many people in that country are embracing the importance of civil society in a democracy,” Meyers said of her time in Burma. “It’s so exciting to see the great gusto and enthusiasm the people of Myanmar have, because you can’t have a democracy without civil society.”</p>
