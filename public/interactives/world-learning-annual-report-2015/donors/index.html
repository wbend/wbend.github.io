        <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In May, I joined World Learning’s CEO, Ambassador Don Steinberg, Board Member Paul Muther and other senior staff members on a trip to Argentina and Chile to gain a deeper understanding of our organization’s academic programs.</p>
 <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In Buenos Aires and Santiago we immersed ourselves in the SIT Study Abroad and International Honors programs addressing issues relating to cultural identity, development, social justice and human rights. We attended lectures and held discussions with our talented and committed faculty members, met with World Learning’s local partner organizations, and heard from students about their experiences. As with all of World Learning’s education programs, those in Argentina and Chile are grounded in experiential learning and independent study framed around critical global issues. My colleagues and I were deeply impressed with both the quality of the programs and with the staff members who are leading them. </p>
 <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Perhaps the part of the trip that made the most lasting impression was an afternoon I spent in the picturesque town of Valparaiso, Chile. There I met Jordan Palmer, a thoughtful student from Vassar College who was participating in SIT Study Abroad’s Chile: Cultural Identity, Social Justice and Community Development program, which examines the political, economic, and social changes that have shaped the country.</p>
 <blockquote style="font-size:2em;">"Our efforts would not be possible without the generosity of more than 3,200 alumni, parents, and friends who have supported World Learning over the past year, many of whom are listed on the following pages. As an alumnus of World Learning myself, and on behalf of the entire Board of Trustees, please accept our sincere thanks to all of the donors in our family who have helped transform the lives of students like Jordan’s." — Tom Hiatt</blockquote>
 <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The afternoon unfolded atop one of the city’s historic hills, which was dotted with colorful houses perched along the Pacific Ocean. I joined Jordan at the home of his host mother, Teresa, who together with her husband, Isaias, has welcomed SIT students into her home for the past seven years.
Teresa prepared a wonderful Chilean lunch, and as we shared our meal together — with Jordan translating in Spanish — we had a very insightful conversation about life in Chile, Jordan’s and Teresa’s thoughts on the program in which they were participating, and on the opportunities and challenges which face Chile as a nation. It was evident that Jordan and his host mom had formed a deep connection that will last far beyond his semester abroad.</p>
 <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Jordan and Teresa exemplified the very heart of our programs: people-to-people connections that foster mutual understanding, break down barriers and last a lifetime. It is through connections like this one that the World Learning global family seeks to create a more peaceful and just world. 
 <p class="lead" style="text-align:left">My journey to Argentina and Chile gave me the assurance that our efforts are indeed succeeding.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Ronald and Kathleen Beck’s support for The Experiment in International Living pre-dates World Learning’s digitized archives. They are lifelong devotees of The Experiment and have been valued donors since the pair graduated from Lewis and Clark College in 1966.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">As such, Ron and Kathy are also members of World Learning’s Global Loyalty Circle, which honors members of the World Learning family who have provided critical support to the organization for at least three consecutive fiscal years.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Kathy was a freshman at Lewis and Clark when the school established a study abroad program in partnership with The Experiment in International Living. She was a part of the university’s inaugural cohort of Experimenters and left for her first trip out of the United States to Japan.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Kathy remembers the experience fondly and as having a lasting impact. Her first time being an obvious outsider, Kathy said she was taken aback at first, “but at the same time it was very liberating because I could not be expected to know how to behave. So I did my best, and apologized when I didn’t. Those things have really made a difference in my life since then.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I’ve learned to be not so self-conscious and to not be afraid of making a wrong step, and laughing if you do,” she said.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“The Japanese people were unfailingly helpful and hospitable,” Kathy recalled. “They took us into their homes, made us a part of society as much as possible.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Upon her return to Lewis and Clark, Kathy urged her future husband Ron to travel abroad and “practically filled out his application.” Ron’s Experiment trip to Mexico was equally impactful — he still remembers one of the highlights being the opportunity to shake Donald Watt’s hand.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The Becks credit The Experiment with feeding their “appetite for international travel.” Since then, they have journeyed to Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Iceland, Peru, the Galapagos, and many other spots across the globe. In 2009, Kathy and Ron even returned to Japan on a hiking tour. “I was taken by surprise by how comfortable I felt there,” Kathy remembered. “I felt at home.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Of being lifelong Experimenters, Kathy said, “It’s given us a real curiosity about how other people live. We always try to seek out opportunities, wherever we go, to meet local people. When we travel independently, we always try to engage with the local culture. Go to the places where the locals go.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The Becks’ spirit of travel and adventure has also been inherited by their son, Colin, who is an SIT Study Abroad alum of the Peace and Justice program in Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The Experiment’s motto, “expect the unexpected,” has persisted as the couple’s maxim. “In our travels I think of that all the time,” Ron said. “If something doesn’t quite work out, well, that’s the way it is.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I don’t think we ever took another trip where we haven’t said that,” Kathy added.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">A lifetime connection to Greece was something Susan Schwartz couldn’t have predicted when she decided to spend a summer in the Mediterranean as part of The Experiment in International Living. “I picked Greece because in fourth grade we studied Greece for the entire year. I had a really good teacher,” she said.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The year was 1966, and at that time it took two weeks by ship to get there, which she says was part of the adventure for a young American student. She lived with a host family in Preveza, a small seaside city in northwest Greece, and traveled with other Experimenters around the country. But it wasn’t the days spent in Athens or the cultural heritage sites such as Olympia and Delphi that made such a deep and lasting impression on her. Instead, it was the warmth of Susan’s host family that has endured for nearly 50 years.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“As a teenager they were better than my real family. I didn’t want to go home,” recalled the Chicago native. “The parents treated me like their youngest daughter.” Susan believes that what makes The Experiment special is the immersive nature of the program which centers on the homestay.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">She’s not the only Experimenter in her family. Daughter Emily went to Mexico when she was 16 and as a result of her experience went on to learn Spanish and Portuguese and majored in Latin American studies. She became a journalist and ran the Dow Jones news bureau in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Said Susan proudly, “It gave her her start. As a result of The Experiment she became a Latina for her whole life.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">At the request of the Vermont office, Susan hosted Helene de Koven, a French medical student from Colmar, while Emily was away. Now Susan, a retired book publisher, says she is trying to convince her teenage granddaughter to be an Experimenter as well.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">This summer, a generous gift from the Schwartz family provided scholarships for several students from the Midwest to take part in The Experiment. She supported the program because she believes it encourages young adults to embrace a global world and creates lasting bonds between people.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Susan has been back to Greece many times over the years to visit her host family and stays in close touch with her Greek sister Elizabeth, who, she says with relief, finally got email. Susan’s Greek family even hosted a 75th-birthday celebration for her mother in Athens several years ago.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">While she laments that there’s no Experiment program for adults, Susan jokes that she and her husband are looking forward to their upcoming “homestay” with her Greek family next month.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The Susan Donna Lessenco fund was established to honor the life, ambitions, and ideals of SIT Graduate Institute student Susan Lessenco. Susan, who was working towards a master’s degree from SIT in 1979, passed away in 1981 at the age of 26 while on assignment for Save the Children in Tunisia. Her father, Gilbert Lessenco, created the fund in her memory so that SIT students could make a meaningful contribution to the world in Susan’s name and in her spirit.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Our students are very active and they have a lot of causes they care about,” said SIT Provost John Lucas. “We’ve talked about the environment, becoming a more sustainable campus, and the need for inclusivity. We’ve talked about social justice. This fund provides students with some resources to make some real progress.”</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">"I feel humble. In most situations I listen harder and am not so insistent on dominating. It’s important to me to reach consensus, to really hear each other, to be respectful, to care." — Susan Donna Lessenco, 1980</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Susan devoted her life to service and development. She worked for the NGO ACTION in Washington, volunteered for the 1972 presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern, and planned to pursue a career in development.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In her private writings, Susan recounted how rewarding her experiences in Tunisia were proving to be, and that she felt herself developing as a person. In January 1980 she wrote, “I feel humble. In most situations I listen harder and am not so insistent on dominating. It’s important to me to reach consensus, to really hear each other, to be respectful, to care.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">It is indeed in this vein that the Lessenco fund will operate in future years. When deciding which project the Fund will help support, SIT students will come together and, as a whole, reach a consensus regarding the use of the funds. “The SIT Student Association will lead the process. They’ll gather input from the whole student body and help the student body come to consensus,” Lucas said. The project that the Lessenco fund supports will benefit not just class members, but also others outside the graduate program, and will enhance understanding of global issues and community development.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“As an elected representative body, I think that the student government can bring all of the students together to prioritize a cause. It’s the best way to ensure that the SIT community is accountable to Susan’s wishes — accountable to the student role,” Lucas said.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“May my work be a voyage of growth,” Susan wrote in a report in 1980 of her time in Tunisia. And it is World Learning’s hope that all those who benefit from and are involved in the Lessenco fund will embark on this same journey of growth, self-discovery, and community service.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">By the end of her experience on the International Honors Program (IHP) in the spring of 2015, Asha Ahmed, 21, earned the award ‘Most Likely to go Native’ from her peers, which she still considers to be a badge of honor.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">While it may have seemed like a joke, ‘going native’ was the very key to the Providence College student’s mission for experiential learning while on the IHP Health and Community: Globalization, Culture, and Care study in South Africa, India, and Brazil.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“In each country we went to I was able to understand certain things because I was trying to live the way the local people are living,” said Asha, who is originally from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and moved to the United States at the age of 12 with shared responsibility for her four-year-old brother. “During IHP I was picking up on things like environmental factors in social and health issues, and how that affects peoples’ access to basic needs, and by the end I was only able to do that because I came to understand the way people live.”</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">"Learn to understand, take control of your education; you have the opportunity to learn from everyone and learn from everything." — Asha Ahmed</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Asha credits IHP, a program of the School for International Training, with putting her Global Studies and Health Policy and Management degree into real-world context.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In India, Asha was able to see the extent to which the caste system still plays a role in access to basic health care; in South Africa, she witnessed how the wounds of apartheid persist in the unequal distribution of resources such as water and sanitation; in Brazil, she studied and saw firsthand the successes and failures of health as a fundamental social right established in the 1988 constitution.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">During the homestay portion of the IHP experience, Asha said, “it was right then that I was able to ask any questions, take my education in my own hands. It wasn’t sitting in classroom or living out of my textbooks. It was a real life experience — things were happening right in front of me, and I had all these resources and the opportunity to research whatever I wanted to.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I just needed to see how my host family lived and the issues they’re facing, and go out into the community,” Asha continued. 
While back at Providence College, Asha serves as a de-facto IHP ambassador — fielding questions from prospective students eager to learn from her experiences on the program. One of the most recurring queries, she said, is “what’s one thing you wish you knew about IHP?”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Sometimes I don’t even know what to tell them,” she said. “Because once I was on IHP, with the help of the IHP group, we were able to figure out everything together as a community and support each other throughout.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Asha advises potential IHP students “the classes don’t end after 5 pm. Go out there, ask your host family questions, try to actually learn about the culture.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Learn to understand, take control of your education; you have the opportunity to learn from everyone and learn from everything.”
Asha Ahmed’s IHP experience was made possible, in part, by scholarship support provided by our generous donors. This year, SIT will award nearly $1.3 million in scholarships and grants to SIT Study Abroad and IHP students.</p>
