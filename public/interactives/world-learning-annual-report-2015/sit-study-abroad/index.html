<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">SIT Study Abroad offers extraordinary experiential education to undergraduate students on semester and summer programs in over 30 countries in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as comparative programs in multiple locations. SIT students benefit from high levels of access to the extensive networks of experts and community members that enrich each program, immersing themselves in the language, culture, and key issues ranging from human rights to migration to environmental change. They get direct, field-based experience from their highly qualified instructors as well as the invaluable exposure and access to local culture within their host communities.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The International Honors Program (IHP), founded in 1958, invites students to examine a critical global issue on a global comparative level. As such, students are able to explore key topics — such as health and community, climate change, 21st century cities, social entrepreneurship and food security — in four contrasting countries, beginning in the US.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Gregory Barber Jr. knows his purpose in life is to be a healer. Growing up in the College Park area of Atlanta, Georgia, he often watched people either give up their lives to the streets or never reach their full potential.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Through my mother, an educator, and my father, a janitor, I was instilled with the belief that I can maximize my full potential through a life dedicated to the service of others,” said the 20-year-old Morehouse College junior, who is double majoring in psychology and African American studies and is this year’s recipient of the Robert Kantor Scholarship.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Currently studying with SIT Study Abroad, Gregory is in Uganda and Rwanda working on an Independent Study Project that examines the impact of the Rwandan genocide on orphaned children and evaluates the different mechanisms used to help them cope with trauma. He wants to apply these best practices when he returns home to help children who have lost a parent either through death, divorce, incarceration, or violence.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Gregory is grateful for the generous support of the donors, a 1997 SIT Study Abroad Brazil participant and his wife, who established the Robert Kantor Scholarship to honor a family member.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Gregory’s first-ever trip overseas also honors another family member. His mother passed away on June 22, 2012 after a 16-year struggle with systemic lupus erythematosus. Gregory was just one month shy of his seventeenth birthday and senior year of high school. Her death created a financial strain that almost derailed his plans to go to college and study abroad. The Bonner Scholars Program at Morehouse College and SIT’s Robert Kantor Scholarship put him back on track for both.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Upon completing his undergraduate degree at Morehouse College, Gregory plans to attain a doctorate in developmental psychology and wants to focus his research on maladaptive development processes, particularly in children affected by traumatic events.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In the meantime, he is adjusting nicely to his new home in Africa, and describes it as beautiful, warm and hospitable. He is enjoying living with his host family and being fully immersed in a new culture.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Studying abroad allows you to be more transparent, more accepting and more understanding of different people, different environments and different cultures,” said Gregory. “I cannot even articulate how thankful I am for the opportunity.”</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">As one of only a few women to become Foreign Service Officers in 1957, Morelle Lasky Levine knows first-hand the importance of international experience to a young person’s career. She served for seven years, holding positions in the U.S. Embassy in Brussels, and was assigned to work on a four -person State Department team coordinating the development of policy for U.S. participation in the newly created Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), all before the age of 29.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In the summer of 1954, between her sophomore and junior years at Wellesley College, Morelle traveled to Oaxaca, Mexico, with The Experiment and lived with a family that owned a general store and had seven children ranging in age from 8 to 22 years of age. “Life as part of that family was a fascinating and joyous adventure,” she recalled.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">She said The Experiment in International Living had a major impact on her life and career.</p> 
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">“I never again viewed ‘foreigners’ as really foreign, and I came to view close personal contact between people of different nationalities, ethnic groups and religions as the best means of dispelling the mutual suspicion and distrust that creates barriers to peaceful co-existence within and between nations.” — Morelle Lasky Levine</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">By supporting World Learning’s initiative to expand study abroad opportunities at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Morelle hopes to give African-American students the chance to gain valuable overseas experience that can help them pursue international careers. A recent summit organized by World Learning with Spelman College was attended by representatives from over 25 of these institutions, the White House, and the U.S. Department of State.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Despite the fact that higher education is now more available to black students than in the past, the lack of study abroad experience, even by faculty members, is retarding the progress that African-Americans can make professionally compared to their white counterparts” Morelle said. “That, in turn, impedes the role that the U.S. can play in this globalized world.”</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">By supporting World Learning’s initiative to expand study abroad opportunities at HBCUs, Morelle hopes to give African-American students the chance to gain valuable overseas experience that can help them pursue international careers.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Support for the HBCU Summit is the most recent gift in a long history of significant contributions provided by Morelle, who is a founding donor to The Experiment Leadership Institute and has endowed two scholarships for World Learning, one supporting The Experiment in International Living, and the other in support of SIT Study Abroad. These are just a few highlights of Morelle’s many years of loyal support to World Learning.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">World Learning Board Member Paul Muther’s career in international business and finance spans four continents and half a dozen countries. Muther credits his experience on the International Honors Program (IHP) with playing a major role in shaping his desire to live and work with people from other cultures, as well as his commitment to World Learning’s mission and programs.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“It further deepened my interest in seeing other parts of the world and being engaged in them,” Muther explained.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">He heard about IHP, then called the International School of America, as junior at Harvard College and thought it was “a really exciting opportunity to go around the world.” On the program, Muther and 13 other students spent the 1965-66 academic year traveling to Tokyo, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Istanbul, Beirut, Rome, Berlin, Warsaw, and Stockholm, living with host families, and studying comparative economic and sociological systems, philosophy and religion.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">According to Muther, IHP was an “amazing” experience that expanded his understanding of other people and “the struggles that they have to deal with in their daily lives.” He said living in Japan, Hong Kong, and New Delhi were the most impactful as, at the time, the living conditions in those places were so much different from the United States. Muther also saw firsthand serious issues those societies faced, including the influx of immigrants from mainland China to Hong Kong and poverty in India, and was fascinated to learn about the different approaches each country took to address the challenges of economic development.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">After graduating from Harvard, he spent a summer interning in Prague and two and a half years in the Army stationed in Germany, before attending Stanford University where he obtained both JD and MBA degrees. Muther then took a job with The First National Bank of Chicago, where he worked for 30 years in Chicago, London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Toronto.</p> 
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Muther joined the board of IHP, then an independent organization, in 2004 at the request of William Michaelcheck, then chairman of IHP and now a World Learning trustee. When IHP merged with World Learning in 2010, Muther became a member of the World Learning Board. During his time as a trustee he has served as chair of the Finance Committee, as a member of the Audit and Investment Committees, and participated in Advancement Committee activities. Muther said he enjoys working with the other trustees and contributing to World Learning.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I believe in the mission and perceive an opportunity to have some influence with achieving its objectives,” he said of his trusteeship. 
Muther said IHP has been a positive addition to SIT Study Abroad’s portfolio of programs because it provides students with options for their time overseas. He also thinks its “unique” comparative perspective helps students gain a more comprehensive understanding of the program’s themes, which now include global health, human rights, and climate change, among others.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“It offers students the real opportunity to see how different countries or different cultures deal with the core basic issues,” he said.</p>
