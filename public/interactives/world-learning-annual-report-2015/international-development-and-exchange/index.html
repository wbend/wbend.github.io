<p class="lead" style="text-align:left;">World Learning’s International Development programs aim to empower people and strengthen institutions through education, capacity development, and people-to-people exchanges. With over 60 active programs across the world, we help thousands of communities worldwide address critical issues such as youth participation, educational access and quality, the marginalization of women and children, and government accountability. World Learning helps civil society organizations across the world bolster their burgeoning democracies; provides technical expertise in systems strengthening and performance improvement; and conducts language teacher education programs.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">World Learning works with local partners to identify specific needs, resources, and challenges. These valuable local resources inform the design and implementation of our programs and ensure that our partners invest deeply in projects and provide the local leadership required to secure long-term success. Our programs encourage leaders to build connections and consensus to create lasting positive change, while working to eliminate inequality, discrimination, and oppression.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Each year, World Learning also brings emerging leaders from around the world to the United States to participate in international exchanges. We administer youth exchange programs, which aim to foster greater understanding and respect between the youth of the United States and other countries. Our dynamic, experiential curricula focus on leadership, global issues, peacebuilding, dialogue, activism, civics, and volunteerism. World Learning facilitates professional development exchange programs, which are designed for individuals seeking short-term learning experiences through site visits, office meetings, panel discussions, internships, volunteering, and other experiential activities. Our academic exchanges place international students in U.S. colleges and universities to strengthen their leadership and career-specific skills through high-quality programs while they explore U.S. culture and create strong ties with their host communities.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">These programs provide youth, students, and professionals alike with opportunities to acquire new skills, as well as address existing needs of the participants and their communities. Our exchange and training programs cover a wide range of sectors and themes, including agriculture, economic development, and education, and are all grounded in a pervading mission to foster a strong bond between the United States and the country of the visiting participants.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">World Learning is proud to lead the Education Consortium for the Advancement of STEM in Egypt (ECASE) project, building a STEM school model that the Ministry of Education can replicate throughout the country. The network of schools is designed to transform the way Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are taught in Egypt. The project, which began in 2012, is a four-year, $25 million Cooperative Agreement funded by USAID to establish five state-of-the-art secondary STEM public schools. Two high schools — a boys’ school and a girls’ school (see MoneyGram support story) — located in the suburbs of Cairo are already up and running. Three more schools will open this year in other parts of the country and the Egyptian Ministry of Education (MOE) plans to open four more STEM schools this year as well.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The ECASE STEM education model stresses the application of critical thinking by students to address real world problems facing Egypt and other countries today. The curriculum was developed collaboratively with World Learning’s ECASE counterparts from the Ministry of Education in addition to three STEM partners.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Students learn how to think outside the box, conduct experiments and work in teams. The schools help develop leaders and agents-of-change who can design solutions to their country’s greatest challenges, such as pollution, desertification, renewable energy, garbage collection and traffic. “This education is being done in a completely new way,” said Donald Steinberg, president and CEO of World Learning. “What they do at these schools is revolutionary. They put a project at the center of the education process. It’s a self-taught experiential method.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Both of the existing schools have three secondary grades, with each grade serving about 150 students. The capacity for each school is around 450 students, and they currently serve approximately 800 students.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">One of the main challenges facing ECASE has been identifying teachers who can deliver the newly designed curriculum. “Not only does the new curriculum require a high level of content mastery in each of the subjects, such as, mathematics and science, but it also needs the use of teaching methods and pedagogy that are far from the rote learning Ministry of Education teachers are used to and more centered around the student,” noted Hany Attalla, World Learning’s chief of party in Egypt. “This necessitated a robust and continuous level of professional development delivered to all teachers to upgrade their capacity.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Students from these two schools have already received international awards. Last May, a high school junior from the girls school in Maadi won a first place award in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for her project purifying drinking water using rice straw. Also this year, a junior from the boys school in 6th of October City won a third place award in the Taiwan International Science Fair for using black mustard for Hepatitis C patients to prevent the virus progression.</p>
	
<h2 style="text-align:left">MoneyGram</h2>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In 2014, MoneyGram Foundation continued its support of World Learning by providing a generous grant to a key education program in Egypt. The partnership between MoneyGram and World Learning began in 2013 when the foundation invested in one of World Learning’s education programs in Ethiopia.
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">This year’s $43,725 grant from the foundation provided laptops to 75 students attending a groundbreaking new all-girls Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) secondary school in the Maadi district of Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The free-to-attend school is part of World Learning’s Education Consortium for the Advancement of STEM in Egypt (ECASE) program, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">MoneyGram International, a 70-year old global provider of innovative money transfer and payment services, launched the foundation in 2012 to help children around the world gain access to educational facilities and learning resources.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Referring to the grant awarded to World Learning for the Maadi School, Jacqueline Lowe, MoneyGram foundation director said, “We love to educate underserved populations. Providing laptops for innovative curriculum elevates their education and connectedness to the world. World Learning is an excellent model for improving education with measurable impact.“</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In 2013, World Learning’s programs in Ethiopia inspired an initial $25,000 gift from the newly founded MoneyGram Foundation to train teachers in the Aflatoun methodology — a social empowerment and financial education curriculum for children taught in more than 100 countries around the world. The grant also supported translating the curriculum into the Ethiopian languages of Amharic and Afan Oromo, enabling World Learning to train teachers in more remote regions, where educators may not speak English.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">For a company like MoneyGram, supporting financial literacy education to youth was a perfect fit.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Everything the MoneyGram Foundation does is inspired by our customers and partnering with World Learning allows us to make a difference in the communities where they live and work,” said Lowe. “We are very honored to partner with World Learning and would look to do so in the future.”</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">This August, sixteen Japanese and Korean young women (eight from each country) and four adult mentors (two from each country) participated in an exchange program facilitated by World Learning and funded by the State Department, which focused on building their leadership and entrepreneurial skills.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The primary objectives of the program were to support the students as they developed into young adults with a strong sense of civic responsibility, an entrepreneurial mindset, a commitment to community development, an awareness of current and global issues, strong interpersonal leadership skills, and a willingness to foster relationships among youth from different ethnic, religious, and national groups in Japan, South Korea and the United States.</p>

</div>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The sixteen students participated in homestays across the United States, where they were immersed in American culture and strengthened their English skills. They also planned for the implementation of community service projects upon their return home, which were presented to World Learning staff on August 26. The projects focused on issues ranging from library fundraising and book exchange, to developing an English-speaking forum through Skype for Japanese and Korean students.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">One of the highlights for the group after their homestay visits across the country was the chance to attend a screening of a Voice of America (VOA) documentary at the World Learning headquarters in Washington, DC. The film, entitled A Single Step, was hosted and narrated by Academy Award winner Sally Field, and focused on women who have made it their clarion call to challenge the status quo and motivate women to participate in issues such as human rights, health, politics, climate change, civil society, and the economy. One of the women profiled in the documentary, Dr. Sachiko Kuno, resonated especially with the exchange group, as she is a Japanese entrepreneur and leader within the pharmaceutical field. VOA brought a film crew to the screening to capture the young women’s reactions to the documentary, during both the film and a post-viewing discussion. A Single Step centers on the Beijing+20 initiative to reexamine the role of women in the international arena and will soon be distributed to American embassies worldwide.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Lebanon is now home to more than one million refugees from Syria, which puts pressure on a public education system already challenged by shortages of qualified teachers and aging infrastructure. In an effort to help the country’s schools address these issues, World Learning is working with the Lebanese government to close the quality gap between private and public education while managing the influx of Syrian students through phase two of the Developing Rehabilitation Assistance to Schools and Teacher Improvement Program (D-RASATI 2).</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“World Learning believes education is the driving force behind positive, sustainable development,” said Carol Jenkins, World Learning executive vice president for global development. “We’re proud to be part of a program that will help ensure the quality of public education in Lebanon to provide all of the country’s children with a strong foundation for success.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The program targets schools and communities hosting a high number of Syrian refugees and will provide trainings for school staff to improve support for the Syrian students, reduce tensions between students, and help alleviate the strain on the public school system. World Learning is implementing the $29 million initiative with partner organizations AMIDEAST and the American University of Beirut, and service providers American Lebanese Language Center and Digital Opportunity Trust.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Dr. Wafa Kotob, World Learning’s chief of party in Lebanon, said the project is in the process of fundamentally reforming Teaching English as a Second Language (TESOL) throughout the public school system, which will benefit more than 60,000 Lebanese and Syrian students.</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">"Education is the driving force behind positive, sustainable development." — Carol Jenkins</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“World Learning has helped the Lebanese government substantially improve English language teaching methods by building a network of TESOL master trainers,” she said. “These new instructors have already provided trainings to hundreds of educators.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In addition, the project recently outfitted 126 public schools across Lebanon with computer equipment to advance the use of technology in the classroom. It also provided training to more than 700 teachers on how to effectively incorporate the technology to support English, Arabic, and science education.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">US Ambassador to Lebanon David Hale attended a ceremony celebrating the achievement and said educational endeavors like this are a crucial part of the United States government’s commitment to help students “have access to the high-quality education that they deserve and that they need to be active members of their communities, and contribute to peace and prosperity.”</p>
