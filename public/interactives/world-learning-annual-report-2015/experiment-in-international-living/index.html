<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The Experiment in International Living has offered immersive experiential learning programs abroad since 1932, and today conducts over thirty programs in countries ranging from Argentina to Tanzania to Mongolia. The Experiment takes high-school age students on three, four, and five week summer programs that are immersive, intensive, and transformative. Through innovative, theme-based curriculum, students engage in hands-on experiential learning, through which they gain invaluable new skills, connections, awareness, and knowledge that helps them thrive in diverse, intercultural environments.</p>
	
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Experimenters forge lifelong bonds with their host communities, host families, and fellow Experiment participants and leaders. They are able to see their Experiment country through a theme-based lens, and engage in a wide variety of cultural, academic, and leadership-focused activities that are carried out with trusted local partners. Students have access to sights, experiences, and communities that give them an authentic taste of what it is to live in a foreign country and be a citizen of the world.</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">A natural entrepreneur, ’73 Netherlands Experimenter Peggy Koenig was determined to make the most of her first time outside of the United States, on a trip that she says made a lasting impression, even so many years later.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">It was on her trip that Peggy recalled she learned the extent of her independence and resourcefulness. “It was the whole idea of going to another country and seeing how people live, similar and different from the way I grew up, getting comfortable living with a family that was not my own family,” she said.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Peggy also looks back fondly on the opportunity to forge strong bonds with her Dutch host siblings, as well as “building new relationships with the participants from The Experiment from the U.S. who were very diverse and from all over the country.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Now, as managing partner and co-CEO of ARBY Partners, a private equity investment firm, Peggy leads an organization of over 60 people and manages $13 billion of capital across business, growth equity and media communications platforms. She says the key to maintaining such a successful venture is being able to “innovate around the edges.”</p>
<blockquote style="font-size:2em;">“As I have continued to develop in my career it has become increasingly important to me to figure out ways to have impact beyond the things I do day in and day out, and that means social impact.” — Peggy Koenig</blockquote>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">While many of the qualities that make her the businesswoman she is today are innate, Peggy believes that those attributes were given the chance to flourish while on The Experiment as a teen.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I am always comfortable saying yes to new opportunities, new experiences and new sets of people and not ever feeling fearful that I wouldn’t gain something from being open to new experiences,” she said. “I don’t know if it was The Experiment or how I am as a person but I think that being comfortable in new situations...and standing on your own two feet in new situations was a building block.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">A graduate of The University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, Peggy serves on numerous boards, including the Board of Trustees at Cornell University and the Boston Medical Center. She believes wholeheartedly that those in positions to make a difference should do their best to impact the lives of others.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Of World Learning and The Experiment, Peggy said, “This is one of the organizations that had an impact on me and so I wanted to be in support of it.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Peggy has been a longtime supporter of The Experiment, and is proud to see it focusing increasingly on critical global issues — with programs that focus on gender equality and human rights in the Netherlands, global youth activism in Ireland, social justice in South Africa, and public health in India.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“It is not just about cultural exchange, but about working on projects that have social impact,” she said of The Experiment. “That is something I support because that is how I continue to spend a meaningful part of my life.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“As I have continued to develop in my career it has become increasingly important to me to figure out ways to have impact beyond the things I do day in and day out, and that means social impact.”

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In partnership with Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, World Learning established the inaugural Experiment Leadership Institute Digital Media Fellowship to South Africa and India this summer.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The fellowship is awarded to two outstanding journalism students from Northwestern’s prestigious Medill School, and embeds them with an Experiment Leadership Institute group to gather multimedia material, and work with Experiment students to craft their own stories, blogs and videos. It is a unique opportunity for aspiring young journalists to experience the gratifying, challenging long-term international assignment and put their journalism and story-telling skills to the test, while also helping Experiment youth find their voices.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Leah Varjacques ’15 and Lauren McCracken ’16 were chosen as the 2015 Digital Media Fellows from a highly talented pool of applicants after a rigorous and competitive selection process. Their fellowships were funded generously by Experimenter alum Peggy Koenig.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">During their trips, Varjacques and McCracken captured hundreds of hours of video footage and photos, and helped several students craft blogs for the PBS Newshour website.</p>

</div>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Medill has been proud to work with World Learning, especially on an initiative that has provided such a fantastic opportunity for our journalists-in-training to get on-the-ground experience and valuable skills, as well as an eye-opening foreign experience and memories that will last a lifetime,” said Josh Meyer, director of education and outreach at the Medill National Security Journalism Initiative.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Varjacques came to the fellowship an accomplished journalist and two-time documentarian. An SIT Study Abroad alumna (Salvador de Bahia, Brazil), Varjacques has held internships at news publications in South Africa and Chicago. She said her time as a Fellow with the Experiment Leadership Institute in India was special because of the opportunity to mentor Experimenters in her craft, while simultaneously honing her own journalism skills.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“I worked on a video with three students to engage them in the reporting process and show them how to cut and edit a video,” Varjacques said. “I also saw a huge improvement in my photography. I gained crucial experience for my aspirations to become a documentary filmmaker as I learned how to build trust and be a ‘fly on the wall.’”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">McCracken, who has worked as a multimedia journalist in both France and the U.S. and won the Washington Post’s Young Journalist Leadership Award in 2012, joined the Experiment Leadership Institute in South Africa.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“As a World Learning Digital Media Fellow in South Africa, I learned that I can do so much more than I ever expected,” McCracken said. “Now I know to trust myself and my journalistic instincts, and that I’m capable of completing creative projects of a large scale if I really set my mind to it,” she said.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“In Medill, we often focus on learning how to adapt to an ever-changing industry and world — whether that applies to our subject matter, our platforms or our audience. I don’t think there’s any better way to do that than to work with a group of such intelligent, engaged, unique young people.”</p>

<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The Experiment in International Living is proud to be providing international experiences for 124 young men of color participating in one of the country’s most exciting new academic achievement programs, UBS NextGen Leaders.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Inspired by President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper initiative, UBS NextGen Leaders helps lower-income, first-generation-to-college young men of color from across the New York City metro area achieve college and career success through academic and career-focused activities that support them from their junior year of high school through college graduation.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Thanks to a historically generous grant of $725,000 from UBS, each UBS NextGen Leader kicked off his experience with The Experiment. Spread across The Experiment’s programs in groups of two to four, UBS NextGen Leaders kayaked in Spain, trekked in Tanzania, and rode horses in Mongolia. For many, it was their first time leaving the United States.</p> 
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Dr. Aaron Morehouse, executive director of The Experiment, said that UBS partnered with The Experiment in large part thanks to The Experiment’s long history with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO), the mentoring organization with which UBS is partnering for much of the program’s college achievement-focused programing.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“We’ve had a running partnership with SEO for many years now,” said Morehouse. When UBS and SEO wanted to add an international experience to the UBS NextGen Leaders program, “they came to us because we’re the best at providing this kind of experience for young people.”</p> 
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“When it came time for the students in our UBS NextGen Leaders program to begin college, we were keen to help them gain a broader worldview and a deeper understanding of different languages, religions, and customs that they could apply to their studies,” said Lori B. Feinsilver, head of community affairs & corporate responsibility, Americas, at UBS. “With its 80-year history introducing young people to new cultures, World Learning was a natural fit, and has been a great partner in encouraging our students to dream big.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In addition, Morehouse emphasizes that programs like UBS NextGen Leaders could lead to greater diversity in international fields in which minorities historically have been underrepresented.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“When we look at the worlds of business, foreign affairs and diplomacy, or NGOs and non-profits, there is a recognition for the need to build diverse leadership,” Morehouse said. “Diversity and inclusion in these fields has the known benefit of stronger and better outcomes and more innovation.”</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“If we want the global leaders of tomorrow to truly represent the makeup of the U.S. and the world as a whole, we need to diversify,” Morehouse added.</p> 
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">Diversity on program enables Experimenters to learn about the United States as well as their host country. Arriving with varying ethnicities, regional backgrounds, and cultures, Experimenters solve problems together and learn to live as a group, often forming bonds that last a lifetime. Writing in post-program essays, participants described their groups as “a single unit” or “family.”</p> 
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">The grant that UBS provided to support UBS NextGen Leaders is one of the largest The Experiment has received, and the partnership between UBS, SEO, and The Experiment is a model for how the impact of international experience can be amplified through strong and visionary partners. 
Additional support came through the UBS Challenge, in which The Experiment and World Learning community raised over $100,000 towards UBS NextGen Leaders’ experiences.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">In addition to the UBS NextGen Leaders program, The Experiment works with over 60 mentoring organizations around the United States to identify promising young leaders and help finance their trips abroad. Still, Morehouse says that there is plenty of room to grow these partnerships.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">“Every single dollar that comes into The Experiment helps us to continue our commitment to inclusion and diversity,” said Morehouse. “And there’s a growing demand.”</p>
