			World Learning is proud to host the 2016 International Women of Courage as part of an exchange program sponsored by the U.S. Department of State.

<p> The International Women of Courage Award annually recognizes women around the globe who have demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equality and women’s empowerment, often at great personal risk. The group of 14 extraordinary women received their awards from Secretary of State John Kerry in a ceremony at the State Department on March 29. <p>

<p> “This year we recognize a group of women who are demonstrating courage in three pivotal areas, Secretary Kerry said of the honorees. “They are exposing and opposing gender-based violence, they are combating corruption and strengthening rule of law and they are promoting justice and human rights for all.” <p>

<p> Since the inception of this award in 2007, the Department of State has honored nearly 100 women from 60 different countries. To mark the tenth anniversary of the award the State Department hosted a forum after the ceremony. <p>
