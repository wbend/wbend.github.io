Pressure increased on Russia; EU and U.S. announced further sanctions, in-cluding economic ones late July. Rebels controlling area around crash site impeded investigation efforts in days following incident; later reportedly agreed to allow access to site, investigation hindered by heavy fighting in area; international investigative team reportedly reached site late month. Continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and govt forces in Luhansk and Donetsk regions: rebels 5 July abandoned northern Donetsk town of Slovyansk, withdrew to Donetsk city; main rebel commander Igor Girkin-Strelkov complained of inadequate Russian military support before retreat. Govt forces captured small rebel garrisons elsewhere in east but lost several warplanes, including in days leading up to MH17 incident; another 2 jets downed 23 July. Ukrainian security sources mid-month estimated rebel strength varying from 6,000 to 20,000 fighters, govt forces at 50,000 nationwide.

Taliban mainly targeted Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) guarding voters and polling sites, few reports of direct interference with electoral process. Several polling sites closed due to security threats, mainly in rural areas. Preliminary result announced 26 April: former FM Abdullah Abdullah led with 44.9%, former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani second with 31.5%. Several deadly incidents before and after election day: 17 Taliban reported killed in airstrike 8 April, subsequent reports suggested 11 children also killed; 3 Americans killed by security guard at Kabul hospital 24 April.

Election Commission said polls thus far free and fair, threatened legal action against those committing election-related violence. Impending anti-corruption trail of BNP leader Khaleda Zia, which could see her jailed for life, and prosecutions against JI members by International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), increased potential for more political unrest. Zia 13 April filed petition with High Court challenging indictment against her and her son and seeking stay order on trial, due to start 21 April. BNP\u2019s joint secretary general 15 April said party preparing national movement to dislodge AL govt should trial proceed. High Court 23 April rejected Zia\u2019s petitions, clearing way for cases to proceed, raising concerns of more BNP-led violent demonstrations and strikes; BNP now appealing to Supreme Court. BNP 22 April began \u201clong march\u201d from Dhaka in bid to gain popular support by criticising govt for failure to reach equitable water-sharing deal with India. ICT 25 March listed 7 charges of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d, including genocide, against JI members, allegedly committed in 1971 independence war; also recommended party should be permanently banned. ICT 17 April decided to follow through with decision to indict UK journalist David Bergman with contempt of court for criticising its procedural flaws and biases in blog posts.","URLOne":"http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/04/29/bangladesh-elections-scarred-violence"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[88.43,26.55],[89.74,26.16],[89.85,25.29],[92.41,25.03],[91.16,23.64],[91.61,22.94],[92.28,23.71],[92.6,21.98],[92.26,21.05],[92.32,20.74],[91.7,22.49],[90.83,22.69],[90.59,23.6],[90.27,21.85],[90.02,21.86],[90.07,22.16],[89.93,22],[90,22.48],[89.58,21.7],[89.62,22.32],[89.25,21.64],[89.06,22.12],[88.75,24.22],[88.04,24.68],[89.01,25.29],[88.11,25.84],[88.43,26.55]],[[90.24,22.19],[90.06,21.99],[90.22,22.11],[90.24,22.19]]]]}},{"id":"India (non-Kashmir)","properties":{"Place":"India (non-Kashmir)","Status":"No Change","Archive":"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/crisiswatch/crisiswatch-database.aspx?CountryIDs\u003d%7B674136F5-D8E6-49FF-B192-62A4A714E27B%7D","HeadlineOne":"\u201cRebels kill 14 in anti-election campaign in India\u201d, AP, 12 April 2014.","URLTwo":"","Polygon":"[ [ [ 75.012095315037612, 32.475107787693474 ], [ 75.056608940028468, 32.476180405163134 ], [ 75.210610712568894, 32.35165553439802 ], [ 75.329721458518122, 32.325788049166619 ], [ 75.416347455572122, 32.357069659213892 ], [ 75.512598563409895, 32.313756660686899 ], [ 75.582380616592275, 32.371507325389558 ], [ 75.673819169038154, 32.410007768524665 ], [ 75.726757278348927, 32.477383544011104 ], [ 75.861508829321807, 32.515883987146211 ], [ 75.928884604808246, 32.645822982727204 ], [ 75.89279043936908, 32.816668699139242 ], [ 75.80616444231508, 32.908107251585122 ], [ 75.818195830794807, 32.939388861632395 ], [ 75.842258607754246, 32.946607694720228 ], [ 75.952947381767686, 32.903294696193235 ], [ 76.099730321220278, 33.023608580990448 ], [ 76.220044206017491, 33.064515301821494 ], [ 76.26816975993637, 33.103015744956608 ], [ 76.28982625919987, 33.153547576571434 ], [ 76.535266584186189, 33.22573590744976 ], [ 76.614673748152342, 33.20407940818626 ], [ 76.7325813552536, 33.196860575098434 ], [ 76.91305218244942, 33.054890191037721 ], [ 77.180149006699224, 32.908107251585122 ], [ 77.372651222374756, 32.869606808450015 ], [ 77.391901443942317, 32.896075863105402 ], [ 77.485746274084136, 32.903294696193235 ], [ 77.562747160354348, 32.927357473152675 ], [ 77.625310380448909, 32.973076749375615 ], [ 77.707123822111015, 33.013983470206668 ], [ 77.847891067323744, 32.886450752321622 ], [ 77.935720203225699, 32.751699201348742 ], [ 77.93331392552976, 32.692745397798113 ], [ 78.007908534104033, 32.613338233831954 ], [ 78.076487448438442, 32.613338233831954 ], [ 78.102956503093822, 32.656651232358946 ], [ 78.167926000884322, 32.689135981254196 ], [ 78.282224191441671, 32.711995619365666 ], [ 78.323130912272717, 32.764933728676439 ], [ 78.366443910799717, 32.754105479044689 ], [ 78.362834494255793, 32.681917148166363 ], [ 78.384490993519293, 32.67229203738259 ], [ 78.30749010724908, 32.608525678440067 ], [ 78.275005358353837, 32.537540486409711 ], [ 78.282224191441671, 32.489414932490824 ], [ 78.312302662640974, 32.478586682859081 ], [ 78.402839096232228, 32.540485191005516 ], [ 78.77, 31.31 ], [ 81.03, 30.2 ], [ 80.06, 28.84 ], [ 82.07, 27.91 ], [ 83.29, 27.34 ], [ 84.15, 27.51 ], [ 85.86, 26.57 ], [ 88.01, 26.36 ], [ 88.14, 27.87 ], [ 88.83, 28.01 ], [ 88.92, 27.32 ], [ 89.64, 26.72 ], [ 92.07, 26.86 ], [ 91.66, 27.76 ], [ 92.54, 27.86 ], [ 94.65, 29.33 ], [ 95.39, 29.04 ], [ 96.08, 29.47 ], [ 96.62, 28.79 ], [ 96.4, 28.35 ], [ 97.35, 28.22 ], [ 96.89, 27.61 ], [ 97.14, 27.09 ], [ 96.19, 27.27 ], [ 95.14, 26.61 ], [ 94.15, 23.86 ], [ 93.34, 24.08 ], [ 93.2, 22.26 ], [ 92.6, 21.98 ], [ 92.28, 23.71 ], [ 91.61, 22.94 ], [ 91.16, 23.64 ], [ 92.41, 25.03 ], [ 89.85, 25.29 ], [ 89.74, 26.16 ], [ 88.43, 26.55 ], [ 88.11, 25.84 ], [ 89.01, 25.29 ], [ 88.04, 24.68 ], [ 88.75, 24.22 ], [ 89.06, 22.12 ], [ 89.07, 21.61 ], [ 88.71, 21.57 ], [ 88.67, 22.2 ], [ 88.25, 21.55 ], [ 88.2, 22.16 ], [ 87.91, 22.42 ], [ 88.17, 22.09 ], [ 86.96, 21.38 ], [ 87.03, 20.67 ], [ 86.42, 19.98 ], [ 85.43, 19.89 ], [ 82.36, 17.1 ], [ 82.3, 16.58 ], [ 80.28, 15.7 ], [ 79.86, 10.29 ], [ 79.32, 10.28 ], [ 78.91, 9.48 ], [ 79.45, 9.15 ], [ 78.4, 9.09 ], [ 77.54, 8.07 ], [ 76.58, 8.88 ], [ 73.45, 16.06 ], [ 72.66, 19.87 ], [ 72.93, 20.77 ], [ 72.56, 21.38 ], [ 73.13, 21.75 ], [ 72.5, 21.98 ], [ 72.92, 22.27 ], [ 72.15, 22.28 ], [ 72.11, 21.2 ], [ 70.82, 20.7 ], [ 68.94, 22.29 ], [ 70.17, 22.55 ], [ 70.51, 23.1 ], [ 69.22, 22.84 ], [ 68.43, 23.43 ], [ 68.74, 23.84 ], [ 68.2, 23.77 ], [ 68.78, 24.33 ], [ 71.11, 24.42 ], [ 69.58, 27.17 ], [ 70.37, 28.02 ], [ 71.9, 27.96 ], [ 74.69, 31.05 ], [ 74.61, 31.88 ], [ 75.38, 32.21 ], [ 75.012095315037612, 32.475107787693474 ] ] ]","HeadlineTwo":"","Update":"Voting in month-long general election began 7 April.

Protests in Rakhine state mid-month against census, escalated to attacks on offices and homes of international humanitarian workers 26-27 March; 1 bystander killed by police warning shot; some 100 humanitarian staff evacuated to Yangon. Commission established by President Thein Sein to investigate allegations of killings of Rohingya villagers in Du Chee Yar Tan village in Maungdaw submitted report to President 28 Feb, finding no evidence to support allegations; also recommended addressing status of Rohingya in Rakhine State, granting citizenship to those who meet criteria under restrictive 1982 law. President late Feb, responding to letter with over 1 million signatures received from monk-led campaign, requested legislature to consider enacting legislation that would restrict inter-faith marriage, conversion from one religion to another, polygamy and number of children, likely to be targeted at Muslim/Rohingya communities. President 7 March appointed commission charged with drafting 2 bills on conversion and balancing population by 30 June; requested legislature to take lead on drafting the other 2 bills, in consultation with Supreme Court.
