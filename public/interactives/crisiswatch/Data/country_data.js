Pressure increased on Russia; EU and U.S. announced further sanctions, in-cluding economic ones late July. Rebels controlling area around crash site impeded investigation efforts in days following incident; later reportedly agreed to allow access to site, investigation hindered by heavy fighting in area; international investigative team reportedly reached site late month. Continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and govt forces in Luhansk and Donetsk regions: rebels 5 July abandoned northern Donetsk town of Slovyansk, withdrew to Donetsk city; main rebel commander Igor Girkin-Strelkov complained of inadequate Russian military support before retreat. Govt forces captured small rebel garrisons elsewhere in east but lost several warplanes, including in days leading up to MH17 incident; another 2 jets downed 23 July. Ukrainian security sources mid-month estimated rebel strength varying from 6,000 to 20,000 fighters, govt forces at 50,000 nationwide. Signs emerged of concern within Russia\u2019s political elite over economic and diplomatic price of supporting rebels: following late June articles in pro-Kremlin media criticising Strelkov, statements from radical nationalists expressed disappointment with Putin; several statements from senior Russian govt officials noted damaging effect of sanctions on banking system.
