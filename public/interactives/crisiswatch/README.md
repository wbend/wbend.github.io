CrisisWatch map
===============
This project maps Crisis Groupâ€™s CrisisWatch publication, which provides succinct updates on some 70 global conflicts on the first of each month. A jQuery datepicker allows users to view the last 12 months of CrisisWatch data. I made this primarily with leaflet.js, and the underlying map is from Mapbox. There is also a mobile version that relies on jQuery Mobile.

The map is available at <a href="http://crisisgroup.be/maps/crisiswatch/index.html" target="_blank">crisigroup.be/maps/crisiswatch</a>.
