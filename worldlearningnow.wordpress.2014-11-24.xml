It was the culmination of a remarkable summer in which more than 140 youth and mentors from Iraq and the US gathered as part of the <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Iraqi-Young-Leaders-Exchange-Program-2014/" target="_blank">Iraqi Young Leaders Exchange Program</a> (IYLEP). Joe Biden, vice president of the United States, asked to take a selfie with the group during their meeting with him at the White House.

At the White House meeting, the IYLEP group sponsored by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) heard remarks from Biden about the hope he has for Iraq. He reminded the group of the struggles and long history the United States has and continues to face in becoming a prosperous democracy. Biden also emphasized that both countries share an incredible ethnic and political diversity in their societies, a diversity that can be promoted and leveraged by youth.

At the White House, after the group shared their experiences and takeaways with ECA Secretary Evan Ryan and Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken, the vice president joined the group for the remainder of the afternoon. The meeting in Washington, DC, took place August 19 during the group's last week in the United States, after they had visited Brattleboro, Vermont; Portland, Oregon; Milwaukee, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. In DC the  youth and mentors built their understanding of civil society and governance at the federal level and developed community projects to implement in their hometowns after the program.

In one of the most diverse programs since IYLEP's inception in 2007, the group was able to connect with each other and share experiences from their daily lives in Iraq and the US, their passions, hobbies, and more. Each individual participant's dreams and community visions were not always the same, yet the group continued to carve a space in which their relationships could thrive for a lifetime. One person-to-person interaction at a time, IYLEP builds communities that strive toward social change, hope, and empowerment. Now the groups have returned home and are staying connected via online networks and regional informal alumni events.

This fall 2014, World Learning will share information about the IYLEP 2015 program and the application process.

Today, September 8, is the International Literacy Day. According to UNESCO, “Literacy is a human right and the basis for lifelong learning. It empowers individuals, families and communities, and improves their quality of life. Because of its multiplier effect, literacy helps eradicate poverty, reduce child mortality, curb population growth, achieve gender equality and ensure sustainable development, peace and democracy."

This year’s theme for the International Literacy Day is “Literacy and Sustainable Development.” As an organization whose mission is to empower communities and individuals, we believe that literacy for all human beings is crucial to create a more prosperous, peaceful, and interconnected world in which sustainable development would not be a goal but a new norm. With over 16 percent of the world’s population still unable to read and write, there’s still a long road ahead to achieve this goal.

In particular, it is important to raise awareness that women comprise a disproportionate share of the illiterate population, often due to chronic gender inequality. It is here where we ought to focus most of our efforts to provide women with the right to read and write, which is a lifelong learning tool.

Check out <a href="http://www.unesco.org/education/ild2014/infographic2014-final.pdf">UNESCO’s infographic</a> and learn about the most updated statistics of illiteracy across the globe.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's fall, the weather is cooling down, leaves will start turning soon, and students are back in class. This semester more than 1,400 students are going back to school through World Learning programs.

Students on <a href="http://www.sit.edu/studyabroad/studyabroad.cfm" target="_blank">SIT Study Abroad</a> programs immerse themselves in other cultures and conduct original research in more than 30 countries.

At <a href="http://www.sit.edu/graduate/" target="_blank">SIT Graduate Institute</a> in Vermont and Washington, DC, master’s degree candidates will prepare to be effective leaders, professionals, and citizens in intercultural and international environments.

Through the <a href="http://blogs.worldlearning.org/global-ugrad/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Exchange Program (UGRAD)</a>, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, college students from dozens of countries will spend a semester or a year at colleges and universities across the United States.

High school students from Eurasia and from countries with significant Muslim populations will also spend a year in the United States through the State Department’s <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Future-Leaders-Exchange-FLEX-Program/">Future Leaders Exchange (FLEX) program</a> and <a href="http://wlacademicyearprograms.tumblr.com/">Kennedy-Lugar Youth Study and Exchange (YES) Program</a> respectively, attending local schools, living with host families, and learning about American culture.

Master's degree students from <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Transformational-Leadership-Scholarships-and-Partnerships-Program/">Kosovo</a>, <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Malawi-Scholarship-Program-MSP/">Malawi</a>, and the <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Masters-Scholarship-Program-for-West-Bank-and-Gaza/">West Bank and Gaza</a>, and PhD students from <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Training-for-Pakistan/">Pakistan</a> will also attend colleges and universities in the United States to pursue advanced degrees in a wide range of subjects including health care, education, agriculture, and more.

World Learning is also continuing its commitment to creating a more inclusive world, by providing accommodations for 21 students with disabilities across its academic programs, both in the United States and abroad.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>World Learning recently began a series of talks called </i>Narratives<i>, which provides a forum for staff to share their experiences in international development. We’ll be chronicling some of their stories here on the NOW blog as well. Check back to learn more about the World Learning staff and their work.</i>

Phillip (Phil) Dierking is a Program Associate at World Learning.

Philip Dierking’s journey as a teacher trainer in Africa began many years ago in his native Alaska. During his a high school years Habib Koite, a Malian singer, visited Phil’s hometown of Juneau. In Phil’s own words: <i>“</i>I don’t know who convinced him to go all the way to Alaska, but I am glad someone did.<i>”</i> It’s not hard to imagine how fascinating it must have been to see all these foreign instruments, music, dances, and culture that are so different from anything in the US, let alone Alaska. This experience triggered Philip’s interest in Africa, which eventually drove him to work as a teacher trainer and help the people of the continent.

Phil spent six years abroad working as a teacher and teacher trainer. Half of this time was spent in Africa, mostly in Djibouti and Togo.

At the time, Phil had just finished his master’s in Teaching English as a Second Language and accepted an English Language Fellowship (ELF) from the State Department). The fellowship tasked Phil to spend a year working with Togo’s Ministry of Education’s training department to do teacher training programs along with four Togolese teacher trainers to train other teachers throughout the country. Most of the work took place in Lom<em>é</em>, Togo’s capital, but he also traveled to other regions of the country. His stay was one full of great experiences, cross-cultural learning, and inspiring people.

“This was an amazing experience for me given the tremendous cultural differences between North America and Africa, and the prevalence of poverty in Togo as compared to the system where I grew up in,” Phil said, adding that nearly 77 percent of Togo’s population lives below the poverty line.

There were many takeaways that caught Phil’s attention throughout his stay in Togo. “Definitely one of the most exciting things was working with the actual teachers and sharing the same experiences,” he said.

Most countries where he worked often lacked essential resources such as books, technology, and even electricity. It was a very different experience from the way education is managed in North America and the resources teachers have. Part of the learning experience in Togo was figuring out how to do the best with what you’ve got through innovative approaches. Indeed there were many locally developed techniques that worked best with the needs of the students.

One challenging aspect of the educational system was that it was very teacher-centered. The general focus was on the teacher’s lecture with little interaction from the students. Their main task was to take notes, memorize them, and pass the tests. As for the bureaucratic burden, it was hard to get things done without permission of the people in charge at various different levels, both local and provincial. Organizing a simple workshop at the school required him to send over 30 letters, back and forth, to teachers, inspectors, regional bosses, the Ministry of Education, and the school masters.

“This made things a little more complicated,” Phil said.

However, as part of the dynamic, there was a stark difference between older and younger teachers. The latter were very open to learning and adapting the latest updates in pedagogy.  Although, Phil’s work as a teacher trainer was focused on many areas, most requests from teachers and students alike, were to promote concepts such as critical thinking, gender equality, and a democratic classroom environment.

Phil said, “They really wanted to know these bigger issues because even though they were not exposed to a lot of resources to support them, they knew were important.”

The interacting with teachers in that particular context required a delicate balancing act.  As a very young white male in Africa, where most teachers were much older and had far more years in academia, it was not Phil’s place to come and tell everybody what to do. That approach would have failed before taking off. “So this was something to always have in mind when teaching in that environment,” he said.<i> </i>

In order to be successful, the important thing to do was to acknowledge people’s previous education. Phil saw his role more like a facilitator who could emphasize the importance of working together and share knowledge and experience in a bilateral way. Through these types of exchanges Phil found the best way to make a contribution as a trainer. He was able to share his knowledge, but also learned many locally used skills and methods.

For example, how can teachers manage to keep a class focused when dealing with 100 young students? They developed techniques such as songs and other call-to-action chants and attention-getters that worked with cultural norms. Whenever the class was getting noisy and students distracted, the teacher would shout “English for all”, and they all replied “all for English”. This worked quite well in getting students focused. “I really found this fascinating, he said.”<i></i>

All in all, Phil learned and grew up personally and professionally. While some aspects made work more challenging, they also made it highly enriching. Currently, Phil works at World Learning organizing similar types of programs and fellowships to the one he worked in Togo. His experience there complements the work he does now because he understands the dynamic on the field.]]></content:encoded>

World Learning President and CEO Donald Steinberg and Yahoo! Chairman Maynard Webb last night participated in a fireside chat on the role of technology in STEM innovation. The event was hosted by the New York Academy of Sciences, which recently launched the <a href="http://www.nyas.org/WhatWeDo/ScienceEd/GlobalSTEM.aspx" target="_blank">Global STEM Alliance</a> to improve access to STEM education worldwide. Steinberg and Webb addressed a number of pressing issues in STEM including reforming education models, empowering people through technology, and making the field more inclusive.

The two agreed that current educational models focus too heavily on rote memorization of facts and information. Steinberg said this leaves the world “ill-prepared” to deal with future economic, political, and social systems, which have become more innovative, democratic, and collaborative. He added that this occurs both in the classroom and in the workplace, where employees are often told to continue applying old methods and systems instead of finding new approaches that could be more efficient and effective.

“That’s a prescription for disaster,” Steinberg said.

Instead, Steinberg and Webb said that schools need to better engage students in the learning process to help them become problem solvers and critical thinkers, regardless of their fields of study. Webb believes that finding ways to “make learning fun” will help people gain skills and make the STEM field less daunting than it often appears. He also said that we need to continue cultivating that curiosity and desire to learn throughout people’s lifetimes, through methods like mentoring programs, so they will be able to adapt to a continually changing world.

Steinberg also discussed the importance of allowing students to apply their knowledge and new skills to real-world issues, adding that this kind of educational model is especially important in developing countries. He shared a story from his first Foreign Service post in the Central African Republic, in which he worked with women in rural areas to learn about the most pressing problems in their communities and help empower them  to solve them.

“To me that is what STEM education is about,” he said. “It is about giving people the skills to address those problems that they identify in their society.”

They added that in order to foster development and innovation, the STEM field needs to become more inclusive and welcoming to underrepresented groups, such as women and minorities. Steinberg cited World Learning’s USAID-funded <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Education-Consortium-for-the-Advancement-of-STEM-in-Egypt-ECASE/" target="_blank">Education Consortium for the Advancement of STEM in Egypt</a> (ECASE), which has created a network of five model STEM high schools throughout the country. Approximately 50 percent of the students within this network are girls, and students often learn about and work on projects to address real-world issues that disproportionately affect women, such as respiratory illnesses caused by cooking indoors over wood-burning fires.

Steinberg and Webb concluded the discussion by stating that confronting these issues is not optional because of the realities of continually evolving technology and its effects on the world.

“It’s a must do because the world has changed on us,” Steinberg said.

World Learning recently hosted the Youth Ambassadors Program with Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The program brings high school students to the United States for several weeks to build leadership and civic engagement skills. The students visit different cities throughout the country to live with host families and participate in American cultural events and community service projects. We caught up with two of the students, Irene from Ecuador and Joe from Peru, at the end of their program in Washington, DC, to find out more about their time in the United States and what they learned on the program.

<strong>What has your experience in the United States been like?</strong>

<strong>Irene</strong>: This is the best experience ever because we shared moments with people from other countries, from South America—from Bolivia and Peru—and from here too, American people. I think everything was amazing, I can’t choose just a single moment as the best part because it isn’t. I think everything was unique and everything just was amazing.

<strong>Joe</strong>: It's is very different than my country and the other countries, Bolivia and Ecuador. Especially what I think is the big difference is the people. In our countries I think that most of the people are not friendly, don't care about the environment, and many things. Also in the schools, the education is definitely much better than in my country because I think they give more liberty to the students to you know, talk, to give their opinion. But in my country you have to listen to your teacher and do whatever he wants.

<strong>What were your host families like?</strong>

<strong>Irene</strong>: I stayed in Portland with my host family, just two people. Their names were Michael and Nicole. They were really nice with me, very cute. They really loved me, I think, and they cried when I came here [Washington, DC].

<strong>Joe</strong>: They were very nice with me, they tried to make me feel as if I were at home and that was very nice because we cooked sometimes, we used to go out, they helped me buy, for example, this sweatshirt of Chicago [where my host family lived], because I was looking in all of the places, even in the Woodfield Mall, that is one of the biggest, and I didn’t find anything, so you know we were running from one place to another.

<strong>What project will you implement when you return to your hometown?</strong>

<strong>Irene</strong>: I’m going to work with kids who have trouble, some physical troubles, it’s a personal project of mine, so I think I will take everything that I learned here, all of the skills that I learned, all of the moments that I lived, because I would like to share with them what I did here. All the knowledge that I’ve taken in here, I want to take there and apply it to my project. Some skills of leadership, I would like to apply them and speak to them about it.

<strong>Joe</strong>: I was thinking to collect books from people that don’t use them and places that have books that aren’t being used, so we can take them to the communities of the countryside and give it to the schools and let them borrow them. Because the kids need to learn, need to read, and that’s how they will learn more. We can borrow those books so they can improve their abilities and become more educated.

<strong>Why do you think programs like this are important?</strong>

<strong>Irene</strong>: I think it makes the relationships stronger between each country that came here. It makes stronger the relationships with the United States, and with new friends, new experiences, new skills, and things like that.

<strong>Joe</strong>: Well because we are living between all of the races and all of the countries and we have to improve those relationships. I not only learned from the American culture, because I learned a lot of things, but I also learned about the culture of Bolivia, and of Ecuador. That’s very important because in this world we cannot live, with one [group] on one side and the other ones on the other side. We have to be together because we are part of this world and we need to live together. We need to accept each other as we are. That’s how this program will help us to have better relationships between these countries.

<strong>What was the most memorable moment of the trip?</strong>

<strong>Irene</strong>: On Sunday I ate with the friends of my host family and I made some food from Jipijapa, the city where I am from and they really liked it. It’s ceviche with peanut butter. It’s really delicious. And also I think when we were in the forest [in Portland] there was an amazing view and you feel like you’re at peace and you just concentrate and listen to every single song of the birds and the water that is falling.

<strong>Joe</strong>: Well that’s kind of difficult because everything was very good, but living as an American with my host family was the best part because they made me feel really good and I miss them.]]></content:encoded>

On Sunday, October 5, SIT Study Abroad <a href="http://studyabroad.sit.edu/sn/sit-faculty-staff/faculty-bios/mory-pagel/">university relations manager Mory Pagel</a> spoke at the first <a href="http://www.amwho2014.com/index-2.html">American Mock World Health Organization (AMWHO) conference</a>, hosted by <a href="http://sph.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina’s (UNC’s) Gillings School of Global Public Health</a>. Neha Acharya, a senior at UNC, organized the weekend-long event after attending a Mock WHO conference in Canada. More than one hundred students from all over the country participated.

The theme of the conference was “Health in Times of Conflict.” Among the topics discussed were poor sanitation and the spread of infectious diseases following conflict and healthcare challenges among refugee populations.

Pagel was one of three guest speakers, who also included Steven Wayling, who has worked for the World Health Organization for 25 years, and Heather Davis, a researcher who has worked extensively in the field of public health.

Pagel provided an introduction to <a href="http://studyabroad.sit.edu/sn/programs/critical-global-issues/?cgi=GH">SIT Study Abroad’s global health programs</a>. He emphasized the opportunities for hands-on research that SIT’s programs provide. “Our field-based model and focus on undergraduate research, strong community partnerships in countries where we offer programs, and diverse program locations make SIT the leader in global health offerings,” he says. “I wanted to let the attendees know that students are going abroad and doing research on these same topics that they are discussing at the Mock WHO conference, and so can they.”

He also talked about SIT’s contribution to the field of global public health, which, he says, “can be measured in the hundreds of research projects our students have done over the years.” He shared some examples of these projects with the attendees.

In addition, two SIT alums — Maya Kiel (<a href="http://unc.edu/">UNC Chapel Hill</a>) and Miranda Gottlieb (<a href="http://www.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee, Knoxville</a>) — attending the conference talked about the field research they did as part of an SIT program. Both studied on SIT’s <a href="http://www.sit.edu/arh">Argentina: Public Health in Urban Environments</a> program in spring 2014. Gottlieb is currently serving as an SIT <a href="http://studyabroad.sit.edu/pn/alumni/">student ambassador</a>, and SIT was able to give her a small travel grant to attend the conference.

Pagel noted that many of the students at the conference were likely to attend grad school. “I felt it was important for them to know that SIT programs include the opportunity to do research in areas that will set them on their path,” he says.

SIT recently conducted an alumni survey, and 99% of the respondents who identified as going on a global health program said they went on to graduate school to complete a health-related degree. “That’s an incredible statistic and another example of SIT’s contribution to the field of global public health,” Pagel says.

“SIT is providing transformative experiences for the people who will go on in the field of global health. With this alumni survey data, we can confidently say we’re training future researchers, practitioners, and clinicians. We truly are changing the change-makers.”

Pagel was impressed by the students he saw at the conference. “This is a collection of students from around the country who are committed to looking at public health on the global level,” he says. “They want to be talking about the issues around global health. They want to be researching these topics, and they want to be finding solutions to these issues. That is what we are all about at SIT. We want our students talking about and researching these issues and finding solutions to the complex problems surrounding these issues through research. There are a lot of parallels between the aspirations of these students and what we offer. At SIT, we can provide a platform for students to reach their goals.”

Between September 28 and October 3, Executive Vice President for Global Development, Carol Jenkins visited World Learning’s <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Institute-for-Political-and-Civic-Engagement-IPACE-in-Burma-Myanmar/" target="_blank">Institute for Political and Civic Engagement </a>(iPACE) in Burma (Myanmar) September 28–October 3 to sign a grant amendment and celebrate alumni of World Learning’s programs in the country.

William Zehdner from the U.S. Department of State’s Acquisition Management Office also traveled to Burma to sign the amendment with Jenkins, officially launching the third year of the program and cementing the partnership between World Learning and the U.S. Embassy in Yangon, which funds iPACE.

Building on a decade of educational programs implemented by World Learning in Burma, iPACE provides education and training courses to community leaders involved in political parties, labor movements and civil society. Activities increase the knowledge and practical application of fundamental democratic principles and promote citizen engagement to inform more representative, accountable governance in Burma.

The amendment is a major milestone for the program, allowing IPACE to expand activities long-term to Mandalay – a critical hub of civic and political activity in upper Burma where education programs like iPACE are in high demand. The amendment also allows the institute to implement more ‘mobile trainings’ – a pilot initiative introduced to address a fast growing demand for civic education across the country through short-term courses in partnership with local groups outside Yangon. World Learning hopes to enroll up to 180 democracy leaders at iPACE courses in Mandalay, and reach an additional 180 participants involved in ‘mobile trainings’.

Since the institute was established in September 2012 at the U.S. Embassy’s American Center in Yangon, the program has trained 452 participants from 22 different political parties, 11 labor unions, and 225 other organizations including civil society organizations, media, religious organizations, student unions, women's groups, and others.

While in Burma, Jenkins also hosted a reception dinner with 45 alumni of current and past educational programs, including Training of Trainers (ToT), Foundational Cycle ToT, Qualifications in Language Teaching (QuiLT), Best Practices in QuiLT, Distance Education (with Colorado State University and Indiana University), Global Undergraduate Exchange Program, and IPACE. These programs have been run through the U.S. Embassy’s American Center since 2004. The reunion allowed World Learning program alumni to reconnect, exchange experiences, and share in a few laughs with good food and company.

Jenkins lauded alumni for their successes since taking part in these programs and their contributions as prominent educators, trainers, community and organizational leaders, and civic activists.

"I'm so proud that World Learning's programs in Burma have helped train individuals and organizations to strengthen democracy and civil society," she said. "Burma is a very different place than when I last visited in 2009, and our alumni have been a part of that change by making positive contributions to their communities and the country as a whole."

The reunion reminds us of the World Learning’s rich programmatic history in Myanmar, and how these programs have created a strong core of leadership in the country over the past decade.

“World Learning gave me the encouragement and support I needed for the success I made and for many of those successes to come,” commented one QuiLT program alum.

				<title>Dalai Lama Holds Private Audience for SIT Students</title>

Students studying Tibetan and Himalayan history and religion got the experience of a lifetime last week when they had a private audience with the Dalai Lama. The twenty students participating in SIT Study Abroad's <a href="http://sit.edu/npt">Nepal: Tibetan and Himalayan Peoples</a> program, met with His Holiness during an educational excursion to Dharamsala, India, and discussed the importance of finding happiness within, employing secular ethics, and practicing compassion toward others.

Explaining that he thinks of himself as "one being out of seven billion human beings,” the Dalai Lama said people are all essentially the same and want a "happy life and no more suffering." However, he underscored that happiness can only come from within.

"The ultimate source of happiness is not on money, not power, but within ourselves," His Holiness said.

He told the students that it is everyone's responsibility to teach the next generation and that this work should not fall primarily to spiritual or religious leaders, as it often does now. The Dalai Lama advocated finding a secular approach that respects all religions and those who do not follow any particular religion. He said this is especially relevant because recent surveys have indicated that more than one billion people are not religiously affiliated. While people sometimes believe those not affiliated with religion are not interested in basic values such as compassion and affection, this is not accurate, His Holiness said.

“These are also the same human beings,” he said. “They also want a happy life, and they also have the same potential to create peace of mind.”

The Dalai Lama later added that the secular approach would include all of humanity in the pursuit of peace and happiness.

“Therefore, for these people, the nonbelievers, we should find ways and means to make evident that the ultimate source of happiness is within ourselves, irrespective of whether they are a believer or nonbeliever,” he said. “So I am fully committed to tell people, or to educate people, or to share the secular approach to inner peace.”

The Dalai Lama urged the students to start creating a peaceful and happy world by cultivating peace and happiness within and then sharing it with others.

“Dear human brothers and sisters please keep in mind, the ultimate source of happiness is within yourself and then practice that and share with more people,” he said. Later he added, “We individuals must make efforts. Firstly, create happy individuals, then happy families, then happy communities; through that way it is possible, through awareness, through education, within this century, there can be a happy humanity, peaceful humanity.”

His Holiness also answered questions and blessed each student.

The students said they were honored to meet the Dalai Lama and said the experience would be forever etched in their minds.

“Meeting with His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience," student Mike Greenwald (Wesleyan University) said. "[He is] teaching the importance of compassion, nonviolence, and even secular education; I left the audience with a firsthand understanding of Buddhist core values.”

“It was incredible being in the presence of a world leader who has done so much good for his people and people around the world,” said Mallory Feldman (Tufts University). “I am grateful to him for giving us his time and wisdom. I am also incredibly grateful to my SIT family for making this amazing encounter possible."

Students in the program in Nepal spend about a week each fall semester in Dharamsala as part of the semester-long program, which examines Tibetan and Himalayan history and religion and the contemporary issues faced by Himalayan communities. On this excursion to Dharamsala, the students also met with the Gyalwang Karmapa, the leader of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, to discuss issues including environmental protection and arts and music in spiritual practices.

SIT Study Abroad is a program of World Learning, a nonprofit organization advancing leadership through education, development, and exchange programs in more than 60 countries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Throughout the fall, World Learning has hosted Welcome Back events around the country for this summer's returned Experiment in International Living participants. On October 14,  President and CEO Donald Steinberg, Experiment in International Living Executive Director Aaron Morehouse, and board chair emeritus Stephen Lowey met with 15 returned Experiment students and their parents for a Welcome Back event in  Westchester County, New York. The evening's activities were facilitated by Melanie Brubaker, program officer for The Experiment, and Amy Harris and Julia Gooding, two Experiment group leaders.

"The session was truly inspiring and a reminder that we are meeting the incredible trust that parents and students have placed in us," Steinberg said. "Speaking with the students and hearing about their experiences made it clear just how transformative these programs are."

The event included discussions among all of the attendees and several group activities for students and parents. Morehouse facilitated a discussion with parents, who talked about the positive influence the program had on their children.

"The impact of the Experiment really came out in the evening,” Morehouse said. “Parents noted dramatic changes in confidence, commitment, and leadership in their students."

Brubaker worked with the students to generate stories from their programs and help them make connections between those stories and the skills they gained while abroad. They did this by discussing different elements of the program, such as their group dynamics, the homestay experience, challenges they overcame, and their "Ah-ha" moments.

"The Welcome Backs are a great way to see and feel what the students learned." Brubaker said. "Many students talked about having an amazing summer and feeling they had come back 'different,' but for many of them this was the first time they had the vocabulary and tools to describe and share those points of growth."

See pictures from the event and read some of the students' responses in our gallery below.

Cochabamba, Bolivia, buzzed with the colorful, mesmerizing Day of the Dead traditions. I drizzled <em>Chicha </em>on the ground in respect to the <em>Pachamama</em> and took in my surroundings. To my left stood an elderly <em>Dama de Pollera</em>, looking very reverent by a constructed tower of small candies and pastries, bottles of wine, and fruit, with a photo of her recently passed away son at the top. Along with her neighbors, I prayed, ate, and drank in his honor. My host mother, Ubladina, patted my hand between hers and said, “Thank you for coming, my daughter.”

This moment sums up how <a href="http://www.sit.edu/blr">the SIT program in Bolivia</a> impacted me forever. With its unique integration aspect of a host family, I was able to have the beautifully humbling and fulfilling experience of suddenly becoming part of an identity that until then was so distant and different. My host mother truly made me a part of her family and included me in her traditions, and her inclusion locked me to Bolivia. This personal connection and resulting second nationality provides me with an inner perspective and a driving sense of responsibility for its betterment. This is exactly what drew me back to Bolivia to be doing life-changing work.

I am happily and gratefully the project assistant and coffee cupper in the very impassioned team of the Melting Pot Bolivia Foundation. Claus Meyer, cofounder of NOMA, the restaurant named four times the best in the world, initiated our foundation to empower the richness and diversity of Bolivia’s gastronomic culture and employ it as a motor for socio-economic development. Its exemplar project is GUSTU, a food school dedicated to the formation of Bolivian youth with few opportunities that, at the same time, functions as a fine dining restaurant working exclusively with Bolivian products.

Every day I am inspired by Melting Pot Bolivia projects that combine the playful, composed art of gastronomy with development. The GUSTU food school students never stop amazing everyone around them in how far they have come in their studies and their newfound, zealous confidence in their country and themselves. Living in this new context, I am always learning and growing, from a taking on a warmer, more Bolivian personality trait to being more open-minded. SIT provided me with the tool to be a part of Bolivia’s advancement and empowerment of its gastronomic culture. That tool is to connect to, understand, and respect a different identity, individual, culture, and/or society.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>In the post below, SIT Study Abroad alum Jedediah Fix (a graduate of <a href="http://www.macalester.edu/" target="_blank">Macalester College</a>) describes his experiences on SIT’s program in Mongolia and his later work in Senegal with the Peace Corps and then the World Bank. SIT Study Abroad is a program of World Learning. This post was originally published on the <a href="http://blogs.sit.edu/sitstudyabroad/2014/11/08/from-mongolia-to-senegal/">SIT Study Abroad blog</a>.

<a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527727/Mongolia-1_whlz2q.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9860" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527727/Mongolia-1_whlz2q.jpg" alt="Mongolia" width="500" height="333" /></a>By Jedediah Fix

I arrived in Mongolia wearing sandals. It was February 2004 and I was a junior in college, eager for my first experience abroad. I was full of energy, curiosity, and the angst of being on the edge of something — but not knowing exactly what. Looking back on it, I was also predictably naïve. And not only in the sense that I brought sandals to a country where the temperature was regularly dropping to minus 30 degrees.

SIT staff greeted our group of 14 at the airport. Leaving the baggage claim, someone suggested I change into shoes. I complied, somewhat begrudgingly.

The initial weeks went quickly. We mastered the route from student dorm to SIT Center (left at the first big Soviet statue, right at the second one), got used to sounding out letters from the Cyrillic alphabet, and learned to order tea and dumplings in Mongolian. Later, we moved to homestays not far from Genghis Khan’s birthplace on the border with Russian Siberia.

<a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527602/Mongolia-2_nes7b4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9861" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/h_218,w_300/v1416527602/Mongolia-2_nes7b4.jpg" alt="goats in Mongolia" width="300" height="218" /></a>My host father, Batbold, was young, strong, and kind. Like most rural Mongolians, he was a herder and moved his family between four seasonal pastures where, following Buryat custom, they lived in small, sturdy cabins as opposed to yurts found in other parts of the country.

In the mornings, students would meet for language lessons, commuting across the steppe by horse. Afternoons we spent with host families. Speaking little Mongolian and being generally clueless about herding and household chores, I studied and drank tea with visitors. For weeks, I watched unfamiliar faces show up at the cabin door, knocking softly before, without a word, entering, taking a seat at the single small table by the window, and helping themselves to thick bread, fresh butter, and salty milk tea. Initially, I assumed these were friends and neighbors familiar to their hosts. Later, I learned that many were strangers — or acquaintances at best — and that I was really witnessing a custom of unconditional hospitality that evolved as a matter of necessity in such a harsh and unforgiving environment.

[caption id="attachment_9859" align="alignleft" width="223"]<a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527728/Jed-and-map-223x300_ddbkxi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9859" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527728/Jed-and-map-223x300_ddbkxi.jpg" alt="Jedediah holding a map from his homestay family" width="223" height="300" /></a> Jed shows the map his homestay family member drew for him.[/caption]

Another moment from this initial homestay stuck with me and has come to represent what I see as an essential value of cross-cultural exchanges — in particular, the SIT pedagogy grounded in experience and reflection. As an aspiring geographer, I was used to observing maps of places constructed from above. When I asked a family member to draw me a map of the surrounding countryside, however, I received a landscape drawn as if standing on the nearest hilltop, with its overlapping flow of hills, streams, and pastures.

This difference may seem trivial. But to me, immersed in a new culture for the first time, it was exceptional. Even today, this exercise serves as a subtle reminder of the many ways that we come to understand our environment.

Looking back on it, my time at SIT and in Mongolia also made me a better listener. I arrived focused on having my own unique experience. Slowly, as I became more comfortable in my own shoes, with a better understanding of my own culture and instincts, I recognized the individualism in this outlook. Fortunately for me, the SIT staff, used to watching young people learn these lessons, were gracious and responded with patience and probably humor (and perhaps exasperation).

[caption id="attachment_9858" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527729/Senegal-Peace-Corps-group-300x171_u4wbyb.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9858" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527729/Senegal-Peace-Corps-group-300x171_u4wbyb.jpg" alt="Jedediah and his Peace Corps group" width="300" height="171" /></a> Jed’s Peace Corps group.[/caption]

When I joined the Peace Corps in Senegal years later, I had a better sense of what to expect, more regard for others and myself, and, in some ways at least, more realistic expectations. Sitting around in a village allowed plenty of time for reflection, I quickly realized, and over time these initial impressions and understandings evolved. For one, I started to see culture in more neutral terms — as a set of habits, values, and perceptions that are, for better and worse, changing with time.

The sheer number of languages in West Africa is astounding, with more than a dozen in Senegal alone. People are warm and generous, but there is also a pattern of hard bargaining that can catch the ill-equipped by surprise. Money is always short, and families and friends constantly help each other make ends meet to pay medical bills, put children in school, and, in some cases, buy just enough food to get through the day. This system provides a basic level of social security, but it also makes it difficult to save or to run a business.

After graduate school, a Fulbright fellowship in the Philippines, and a brief stint at the United Nations, I returned to Senegal last year — five years after leaving the Peace Corps — as a consultant to the World Bank. Dakar is a more comfortable place than I remembered, with better roads, more housing, and a rising middle class. The village, meanwhile, remains much the same, with slight improvements in infrastructure, along with a sense that only the young and old are left, while the able toil in the city.

<a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527603/Senegal_yef8j0.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9862" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527603/Senegal_yef8j0.jpg" alt="Senegal" width="500" height="373" /></a>

The world’s attention has become painfully focused on West Africa these past months as Ebola devastates communities. A graduate school classmate of mine is from the outbreak’s epicenter in Guinea and it has been raw — yet inspiring — to follow his thoughts and pleas on social media. Unsurprisingly, the worst hit places share in common the weakness of their health systems and the far reach of their poverty.

Senegal prides itself on its established political stability but also benefits, many would agree, from a sense of compromise that rises from the bottom up. Still, there is much to be done to address the challenges facing this country, including the creation of more accountable and effective delivery systems for basic services. In the health sector, for example, child mortality has fallen dramatically, aided by specific interventions like anti-malarial mosquito nets and immunization campaigns, while maternal mortality, which requires more systemic coordination, remains stubbornly high, at twice the target aspired to by the UN’s <a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/">Millennium Development Goals</a>. I think my time learning about culture and development at SIT provided a helpful framework for considering important questions like these.

SIT’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary moved me to get back in touch with SIT staff, and, ten years after finishing my own program, I have enjoyed closing the loop on my SIT experience, by meeting current students in the Senegal program and sharing a few thoughts as a guest lecturer in field research methods.

Most people think of risks in terms of the potential costs of change. However Alex Dehgan, former chief scientist for the U.S. Agency for International Development, says when we do that we’re failing to ask the opposite, often more important, questions. What happens if we don’t take risks? How many lives will we fail to save? How many people will not be educated?

“It takes risks, it actually takes change, to be able to save lives, to end AIDS, to train people, to address these big development challenges,” Dehgan said in his opening speech at the inaugural <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/support-us/world-learning-events/lewy-global-development-technology-forum/">Lewy Global Development Technology Forum</a>.

Almost 100 people participated in the November 4 event in Washington, DC, which provided a hands-on exploration of how emerging technology can be used realistically and effectively to address the development and educational challenges facing our world today.

“It is perhaps my highest single priority at World Learning to ensure that we’re taking full advantage of new technologies, social innovation, and new ways of thinking as we empower the next generation of global citizens to build peace, prosperity, social inclusion, and responsive institutions,” World Learning President and CEO Donald Steinberg said in his welcome address. [<a href="http://youtu.be/tgDjoymw9ko" target="_blank">Watch Steinberg's full speech.</a>]

[caption id="attachment_9878" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/v1416527601/1306-e1415907282676_x7pfjz.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9878" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/worldlearning/image/upload/h_240,w_300/v1416527601/1306-e1415907282676_x7pfjz.jpg" alt="Hany Atalla speaks during his Lightening Talk." width="300" height="240" /></a> Hany Atalla speaks during his Lightening Talk.[/caption]

Dehgan, who recently founded the start-up Conservation X Labs, framed the day by discussing the need for people to adapt and innovate to solve major global challenges and the opportunities technology provides. He explained that while there is more data and technology available than ever before in human history, we still need to find ways to improve education and expand access to it in order to include all people in creating these solutions and benefit from their contributions. Dehgan also said we need to shape education around critical challenges rather than specific disciplines, envisioning a time when students study a problem, not a major.

“The major doesn’t equip you with the sets of skills you need no matter where you are in the world to be able to address these problems,” he said.

Dehgan challenged the audience to think big, saying the same resourcefulness that was used to land a rover on Mars can be used to fix other world problems.

“It is using the ingenuity of humans, and the tools that technology gives us, and that connectivity it has unlocked that will allow us to be successful,” he said. [<a href="http://youtu.be/mTWnbiQs1IE" target="_blank">Watch Dehgan's full speech.</a>]

Following Deghan’s speech the event featured two rounds of Lightening Talks, short presentations on subjects related to development and technology; a Speed Geeking session, where participants engaged with leading practitioners and vendors demonstrating their products; and Expert Round tables, lively discussions about how to integrate technology into development.

In his Lightening Talk, World Learning Chief of Party for Egypt Hany Attalla described how the organization’s <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Education-Consortium-for-the-Advancement-of-STEM-in-Egypt-ECASE/">Education Consortium for the Advancement of STEM</a> (ECASE) project, is answering Dehgan's call by creating model schools with project-based curricula, in which students apply their science and math skills to create solutions to real issues facing their country.

“You’re not studying physics or chemistry or biology,” Atalla said. “You’re studying how to solve a problem, one of the great challenges that face Egypt.”

Other Lightening Talk topics ranged from using mobile technologies to fight Ebola, to Tech Camps to train young people in Algeria, to community-oriented online courses, to digital experiential learning.

Participants also showed their skills in Speed Geeking—five minute round-robins with leading innovators who demonstrated their latest wares including <a href="https://www.thecn.com/" target="_blank">CourseNetworking</a>, <a href="http://devresults.com/en/p/home" target="_blank">DevResults</a>, <a href="http://www.dyned.com/" target="_blank">DynEd International, Inc.</a>, <a href="http://www.fabacademy.org/" target="_blank">The Fab Academy</a>, <a href="http://home.magpi.com/" target="_blank">Magpi</a>, <a href="http://www.nyas.org/" target="_blank">The New York Academy of Sciences</a>, <a href="http://www.souktel.org/development" target="_blank">Souktel</a>, and <a href="http://techchange.org/" target="_blank">TechChange</a>.

Participants capped off the day with Expert Round Tables, delving into the topics of distance learning and online education; democratizing technology; bridging the user divides; technology for monitoring and evaluation; and social media for networks, alumni, and participant engagement.

Attendees said the event was eye opening and introduced them to new ideas and technologies they would never otherwise have known about, but could now use in their work.

“I think there are so many opportunities for us to be integrating technology better into our projects, not only for World Learning, but within the international development sector more broadly,” said Meredith McCormac, World Learning’s country representative for Pakistan.

Raana Zafar, assistant training manager for World Learning’s <a href="http://www.worldlearning.org/what-we-do/projects/Training-for-Pakistan/">Training for Pakistan</a> program, said she was inspired by Dehgan’s comments that people need to find different methods and approaches in order to confront the world’s problems.

“What really stuck with me is that if we’re not ready to adapt, to change, we’re going to fail,” she said.

<em>The event was funded by a generous contribution from Cheryl and Glen Lewy, long-time supporters of World Learning, SIT, and EIL. Cheryl is a member of World Learning’s Board of Trustees.</em>
