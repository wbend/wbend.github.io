<p>Filmmaker Dan Evans and I traveled to Turkey, Libya, and Kenya (and he proceeded on to Afghanistan) to capture Crisis Group analysts in the field â€” to get a sense of what a day in the life of an analyst is really like. We filmed interviews with Syrian refugees, Libyan militias, and radicalized youth in Mombasa, Kenya. Dan shot and edited the piece, while I recorded field audio, conducted interviews, and served as producer. Kimberly Abbott oversaw and produced the project.</p>
<p>On the Frontlines was featured at Crisis Group's annual New York gala, the organization's largest fundraising event. The 2014 honoree was Hillary Clinton.</p>
