<p>In August 2013, I traveled with a small group of media professionals to Kazakhstan as an International Reporting Project fellow. We ended our trip in Astana, Kazakhstanâ€™s Vegas-like capital, with Norman Foster-designed pyramids and space needles coexisting with dilapidated Soviet apartment blocks. The <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> published some of these photos in a <a href-"http://www.csmonitor.com/Photo-Galleries/In-Pictures/Astana-A-city-built-for-giants" target="_blank">slideshow</a> put together by Ben Arnoldy, another IRP fellow and <em>CSM</em> editor.
