        <description>&lt;p&gt;GDELT, or Global Data on Events, Location and Tone, is a big, free database, updated daily, that claims to monitor &quot;the world&#39;s broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages&quot; and identify &quot;the people, locations, organizations, counts, themes, sources, and events driving our global society every second of every day.&quot; It&#39;s gotten some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/03/half_a_billion_clicks_can_t_be_wrong_mapping_crisis_zones&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/apr/12/gdelt-global-database-events-location&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://aaboyles.com/blog/2014/05/gdelts-unit-of-analysis-problem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;. Many objections point out that GDELT presents itself, and is often used, as a comprehensive database of events, rather than media coverage of those events.
	
&lt;p&gt;GDELT servers intake hundreds of thousands of news reports and use natural language processing to identify discrete &quot;events.&quot; If GDELT&#39;s algorithms determine that another article references the same event, it&#39;s added to the same entry in the database; each entry records how many times the event has been mentioned in world media. A particularly newsworthy event might have dozens of media mentions, but would still occupy just a single entry in the GDELT database. Likewise, a single news story is likely to yield multiple events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt, GDELT&#39;s algorithms are sophisticated, but tapping this database means you&#39;re trusting a computer to distinguish between one event and the next, code it as a &quot;protest,&quot; &quot;meeting,&quot; &quot;missile strike,&quot; etc., and geocode it meaningfully. Plus, as lots of people &lt;a href=&quot;https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/gdelt-decontextualized-data/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; with reference to 538&#39;s notorious kidnapping analysis, it&#39;s pretty na√Øve to assume that news coverage accurately mirrors events on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;All those caveats notwithstanding, GDELT does seem like a good source for tracking how events are covered in global media, rather than events themselves. Given its scale, GDELT could do well for media analysis. Everything below is an initial attempt at using GDELT data for this purpose -- plus a chance to practice some Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I downloaded data for July 29, 2014 from the GDELT site, a TSV file with nearly 150,000 entries. I added column headers at the top so I&#39;d be able to query different rows by name rather than position. Then I used Ruby&#39;s CSV class to import the file. (GDELT files have a .csv extension, despite being TSV files.)

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parsed_file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;20140729.export.CSV&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;col_sep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;header_converters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:symbol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDELT codes events according to the CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations) system, allowing users to, say, pull out all the protests that occurred within a particular date range. (GDELT events are also geocoded, allowing researchers to produce maps like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joshuastevens.net/images/afgEventsSmall.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.) As an experiment, I designated all the codes between 15 (&quot;exhibit force posture&quot;) and 20 (&quot;use unconventional mass violence&quot;) as &quot;violent&quot; events, and tallied the number of mentions GDELT recorded for each event taking place in relation to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;IS&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&amp;quot;IS&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;Israel&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mentions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;violent_events&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;violent_coding?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:eventrootcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;15&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:eventrootcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;16&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:eventrootcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;17&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:eventrootcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;18&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:eventrootcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;19&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:eventrootcode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;20&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:actiongeo_countrycode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;parsed_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;violent_coding?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mentions&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:nummentions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to_i&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;violent_events&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:actor1geo_lat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:actor1geo_long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:sourceurl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;violent_events&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;include?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:actor1geo_lat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:actor1geo_long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:sourceurl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This yielded a number for total mentions (49,190) and, as a further experiment, a list of unique latitude/longitude values and article URLs that could be mapped very easily. Changing &lt;em&gt;nummentions&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;numarticles&lt;/em&gt; produces a count of &quot;source documents containing one or more mentions&quot; of each event: 48,354. Again, this is the number of articles mentioning &quot;violent&quot; events taking place with relation to Israel on July 29, 2014, according to GDELT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran the &lt;em&gt;nummentions&lt;/em&gt; &quot;violence&quot; count on a few other conflicts and came up with the following numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;width:500px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto&quot; id=&quot;chart_div&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing surprising here, except possibly that GDELT recorded more coverage of &quot;violent&quot; events in Afghanistan than in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do actually map these GDELT entries, you&#39;ll find that these aren&#39;t events taking place &quot;in&quot; so much as &quot;relating to&quot; each country. For example, GDELT recorded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/07/28/somali-terror-group-al-shabaab-muslims-must-attack-jewish-targets-globally/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, geocoded to Somalia, as having an &quot;ActionGeo_CountryCode&quot; of &quot;IS,&quot; for Israel. But this isn&#39;t important if you&#39;re simply using GDELT to gauge global media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I&#39;d like to graph these numbers for a longer period of time against casualty estimates for each conflict -- assuming I can find some reliable numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://www.google.com/jsapi&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;

      google.load(&#39;visualization&#39;, &#39;1.0&#39;, {&#39;packages&#39;:[&#39;corechart&#39;]});

      google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

     function drawChart() {

        // Create the data table.
        var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
        data.addColumn(&#39;string&#39;, &#39;Country&#39;);
        data.addColumn(&#39;number&#39;, &#39;Media mentions&#39;);
        data.addRows([
          [&#39;Israel/Gaza&#39;, 49190],
          [&#39;Afghanistan&#39;, 5134],
          [&#39;Iraq&#39;, 3191],
          [&#39;Syria&#39;, 2105],
          [&#39;Central African Republic&#39;, 425],
          [&#39;Honduras&#39;, 227],
          [&#39;South Sudan&#39;, 168]
        ]);

        // Set chart options
        var options = {&#39;title&#39;:&#39;Media Coverage of Selected Conflicts on July 29, 2014&#39;,
						backgroundColor: { fill:&#39;transparent&#39; },
                       &#39;width&#39;:500,
                       &#39;height&#39;:400};

        // Instantiate and draw our chart, passing in some options.
        var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById(&#39;chart_div&#39;));
        chart.draw(data, options);
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Filmmaker Dan Evans and I traveled to Turkey, Libya, and Kenya (and he proceeded on to Afghanistan) to capture Crisis Group analysts in the field ‚Äî to get a sense of what a day in the life of an analyst is really like. We filmed interviews with Syrian refugees, Libyan militias, and radicalized youth in Mombasa, Kenya. Dan shot and edited the piece, while I recorded field audio, conducted interviews, and served as producer. Kimberly Abbott oversaw and produced the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Frontlines was featured at Crisis Group&#39;s annual New York gala, the organization&#39;s largest fundraising event. The 2014 honoree was Hillary Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <pubDate>Wed, 12 Dec 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
        <author>Ben Dalton</author>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece originally appeared on CNN.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By¬†&lt;strong&gt;EJ Hogendoorn&lt;/strong&gt;¬†&amp;amp;¬†&lt;strong&gt;Ben Dalton&lt;/strong&gt;, Special to CNN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: EJ Hogendoorn is Deputy Africa Program Director for the International Crisis Group.&lt;/em&gt;¬†&lt;em&gt;Ben Dalton is a Communications &amp;amp; IT Officer for ICG. The views expressed are their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month&amp;rsquo;s arrest of senior security figures for allegedly plotting a coup showed how close Sudan is to even greater violence and disintegration. Despite the¬†&lt;a href=&quot;http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/03/06/what-the-bashir-indictment-means/&quot;&gt;indictment by the International Criminal Court&lt;/a&gt;¬†of President Omar al-Bashir, South Sudan&amp;rsquo;s secession, billions spent on humanitarian assistance and numerous other international interventions, civil war continues to plague the country. Only managed but fundamental governance reform can help it escape a pattern of chronic conflict and human misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bashir remains a key hurdle, and it is time for him ‚Äì and the international community ‚Äì to face some painful realities. He must confront the fact that the challenges he and his ruling National Congress Party face are the gravest they have ever been and threaten the state&amp;rsquo;s stability and integrity. His own personal position is likely only to become ever more tenuous. International actors need to acknowledge that there is no lasting solution to decades of civil war without the willing participation of the president and the NCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudan needs more than¬†&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/17/world/africa/sudan-south-sudan/index.html&quot;&gt;quick deals&lt;/a&gt;¬†or piece-by-piece regional solutions. The economy is in freefall, because of NCP economic mismanagement and corruption, as well as South Sudan&amp;rsquo;s decision to stop the production of oil that is exported through the north ‚Äì the fees from which are a crucial source of revenue. Meanwhile, the army is being bled and the government coffers drained by ongoing fighting with the Sudan Revolutionary Front, an alliance of major rebel groups from Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The budget crunch has led to austerity measures and inflation, which have driven civilian protests in Khartoum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has also led to growing dissent within NCP ranks. Many members ‚Äì and former supporters ‚Äì are unhappy with the party leadership&amp;rsquo;s, citing the South&amp;rsquo;s secession, misguided policies, and endemic corruption. In response, Bashir has further concentrated power in his inner circle, in effect doubling down on the model that brought Sudan to this desperate point in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP leadership may be tempted by partial fixes that have worked in the past. But getting exports of southern oil flowing once again, or cutting a deal with the weak and fractured opposition, only postpones accounting for the big questions that have driven Sudan&amp;rsquo;s decades of conflict. At root are fundamental defects in how the country is governed, and it remains to be seen whether Khartoum recognizes the need for deep, structural reforms. The window in which the NCP may yet buy some time with half measures grows narrower by the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bashir and company will need to reach that realization on their own, but international actors can help steer Khartoum toward understanding that comprehensive reform is in its own best interest and not simply a selfless matter of enlightened leadership. The United Nations, the African Union and the Arab League could offer concrete incentives tied to specific reform benchmarks ‚Äì carrots rather than the sticks the NCP has come to expect from the international community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if NCP elites take clear steps toward implementing a comprehensive ceasefire and creating a transitional administration, one that includes representatives of the opposition and civil society, then international actors should consider lifting some sanctions, pursuing debt relief, and normalizing diplomatic relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if Bashir supports a process including SRF rebels and other marginalized groups from Sudan&amp;rsquo;s south and east to draft a permanent constitution ‚Äì one that shares power and resources more evenly throughout the country ‚Äì then the U.N. Security Council should consider requesting the ICC defer prosecuting Bashir for one year under Article 16 of the Rome Statute. Of course, if the process stymies or Bashir reneges, there is no obligation to extend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that brutal human rights violations have been committed under Bashir&amp;rsquo;s rule. But there will be no ceasefire or meaningful reform process without NCP participation. The opposition is fragmented and lacks experience. The security services are split, with many still loyal to Bashir. NCP elites could act as spoilers at any stage of what is likely to be a long and complex process. International players may be able to bring the NCP leadership on board by giving them something to gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional ceasefires and deals have failed to bring Sudan stability ‚Äì as soon as one deal is struck, other conflicts re-emerge. Even the secession of the South last year did not end the longstanding dynamic of north-south rancor. The only lasting solution is a comprehensive one, bringing all of Sudan&amp;rsquo;s stakeholders together to reform how power is wielded in a large and diverse country. Over the long term, the status quo is intolerable for all parties: incessant warfare, millions displaced, billions spent on aid, a litany of woes that has been Sudan&amp;rsquo;s reality for decades. If it is to be resolved for good, the NCP and international players will need to offer much more¬†than any time in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece originally appeared on CNN.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By¬†&lt;strong&gt;EJ Hogendoorn&lt;/strong&gt;¬†and¬†&lt;strong&gt;Ben Dalton&lt;/strong&gt;¬†‚Äì Special to CNN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famine has returned to the Horn of Africa, and Somalia is the worst hit. For the first time since the early 90s, the United Nations has declared a famine in parts of southern Somalia, meaning that more than 30 percent of the population is malnourished. All told, 3.7 million Somalis are in need of immediate food aid, part of some 11.5 million in need across the Horn of Africa. Each month, huge streams of refugees cross the border into Ethiopia and Kenya‚Äìnearly 170,000 since January‚Äìspreading the humanitarian crisis with them. Tens of thousands have already died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At fault are three big factors. First, rainfall has been sparse for the past two years, causing widespread crop failures and depletion of food reserves. Second, food prices worldwide have skyrocketed, so the shortfall in produce among the poor cannot be made up in trade and imports. Finally, chronic insecurity in southern Somalia has exacerbated the situation. Much of southern Somalia is controlled by Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group at war with the internationally-backed Transitional Federal Government. Al-Shabaab has also prevented many international agencies from distributing food aid to affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only a matter of time before famine is declared in much of south Somalia. Somalia is at the center of the emergency, but much of the Horn of Africa is at risk. If humanitarian relief does not reach people in southern Somalia immediately, further refugee flows could undermine food security in neighboring countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international community has to act ‚Äìand act fast ‚Äì to stop the growing crisis. As the U.S. and other governments consider their options, here are five things to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.¬†&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let Al-Shabaab deny your humanitarian impulse&lt;/strong&gt;.¬†The U.S. government has voiced concern that assistance to Somalia could end up in the hands of Al-Shabaab, a designated terrorist organization. As a result, in 2010, U.S. aid to Somalia dropped to just one tenth of what it was two years before. It is true that armed groups were &amp;ldquo;taxing&amp;rdquo; humanitarian aid, but this is unavoidable in complex emergencies. Whatever marginal benefit Al-Shabaab derives from foreign aid, it is far outweighed by the goodwill and increased stability that aid generates. This is also an important way to show Somalis and the Muslim world at large that the West cares about more than waging a &amp;ldquo;War on Terror&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt;¬†Instead, think of this as an opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;.¬†Al-Shabaab is not a monolithic organization. It includes both hardliners and pragmatists. In July, the organization made two statements, one appealing for a return of international humanitarian agencies and the other claiming that any news of famine was &amp;ldquo;sheer propaganda.&amp;rdquo; Boosting international aid may help to woo those members willing to renounce terrorism away from the increasingly unpopular hardliners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.¬†&lt;strong&gt;That said, international efforts must work together&lt;/strong&gt;.¬†Attempts to stabilize Somalia must be coordinated and carefully managed. Reporting from Somalia suggests that much internal displacement is directly attributable to military campaigns by the internationally funded Transitional Federal Government. As much as possible, the military push against Al-Shabaab should not aggravate an already poor humanitarian situation. Aid should also not empower re-emerging warlords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.¬†&lt;strong&gt;The best way to prevent famines over the long-term is to foster peace and stability&lt;/strong&gt;.¬†It&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the crisis is much less serious in Somaliland and Puntland, autonomous regions in northern Somalia that have been relatively stable. Immediate, short-term food aid must be followed by longer-term efforts to promote stability and good governance. That means looking beyond the narrow focus of defeating Al-Shabaab. Given a corrupt and ineffective Transitional Federal Government, international donors should not focus exclusively on the central government in Mogadishu, but also support stable, responsive and accountable local authorities. Because of longstanding clan competition and mistrust, a decentralized form of government is much more appropriate in the current Somali environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.¬†&lt;strong&gt;Even if governments don&amp;rsquo;t launch a full-scale relief program, they can still help&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the U.S. should temporarily lift Office of Foreign Asset Control restrictions, which prevent aid groups from operating in areas &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; by Al-Shabaab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international response to famine is typically presented as a humanitarian mission. While that alone more than justifies international involvement, governments should also consider that food aid in Somalia and the Horn of Africa is strategic ‚Äì that it can change negative perceptions about the West and reduce insecurity in the whole region. They should get moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The views expressed in this piece are solely those of EJ Hogendoorn and Ben Dalton.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
