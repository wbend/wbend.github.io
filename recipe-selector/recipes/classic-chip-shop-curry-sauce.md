## **Instructions**

1.  Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add
    coriander seeds and toast until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.

2.  Add garam masala and curry powder to the toasted coriander seeds.
    Toast for another 30 seconds until aromatic, being careful not to
    burn.

3.  Add tomato puree to the spice mixture and cook for 2-3 minutes to
    remove raw flavor.

4.  In a separate pan, heat remaining oil and caramelize sliced onions
    over medium heat until golden brown, about 15-20 minutes.

5.  Transfer caramelized onions to a blender. Add garlic, ginger,
    coriander stalks, lemon juice, and a splash of vegetable oil.

6.  Add the spice and tomato mixture to the blender.

7.  Pour in chicken stock and blend until smooth.

8.  Transfer mixture back to a pan and simmer for 10-15 minutes to
    develop flavors.

9.  Season with salt to taste.

10. Stir in heavy cream and ketchup.

11. Blend again using either a stick blender or regular blender until
    completely smooth.

12. Pass the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer for a silky smooth
    texture.

Note: The addition of ketchup provides that authentic chip shop flavor
and helps create the perfect consistency.
