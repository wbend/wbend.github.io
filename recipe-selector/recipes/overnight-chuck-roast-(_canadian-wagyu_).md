-   4-5 pound chuck roast

Seasonings:

-   2 tablespoons kosher salt

-   2 teaspoons black pepper

-   1 cup water (for the pan)

Optional Smoking Ingredients:

-   Wood chips of choice

-   Additional seasonings as desired

## **Instructions**

1.  Initial Seasoning (3-4 hours before cooking):

    -   Pat chuck roast dry with paper towels

    -   Season generously with salt and pepper on all sides

    -   Let rest uncovered in refrigerator for 3-4 hours to allow
        seasonings to penetrate

2.  Preheat:

    -   Set oven to 200°F (93°C)

    -   Place rack in middle position

3.  Optional Smoking Step:

    -   If desired, smoke the seasoned roast for 2-3 hours at 200°F

    -   Use wood chips of choice

4.  For Oven Method:

    -   Place roast in a roasting pan or deep baking dish

    -   Add 1 cup water to the bottom of the pan

    -   Cover tightly with foil

5.  Slow Cook:

    -   Place in preheated oven

    -   Cook for 10-16 hours depending on desired texture:

        -   10-12 hours for firmer texture

        -   14-16 hours for more tender result

    -   DO NOT exceed 16 hours as meat will become dry

6.  Rest and Serve:

    -   Remove from oven

    -   Let rest for 15-20 minutes

    -   Slice against the grain

For Sous Vide Method:

1.  Set sous vide to 135°F (57°C) for medium-rare

2.  Vacuum seal seasoned roast

3.  Cook for 10-16 hours

4.  Optional: Sear in hot cast iron pan before serving

Notes:

-   Aim for 10-16 hours cooking time; longer cooking will result in
    drier meat

-   The meat should be tender but still sliceable

-   Internal temperature will reach medium-rare while maintaining a
    tender, gelatin-rich texture

-   Can be prepared before bed for next-day dinner

-   Look for a well-marbled chuck roast for best results
