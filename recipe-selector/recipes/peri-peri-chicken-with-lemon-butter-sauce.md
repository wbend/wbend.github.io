## **Instructions**

1.  Roast red bell pepper on high heat until skin is charred and flesh
    is soft. Let cool, then peel off and discard the skin.

2.  In a food processor, combine roasted pepper, red chilies, yellow
    onion, basil, garlic, salt, sugar, black pepper, lemon juice, white
    vinegar, and water.

    chicken pieces and marinate for at least 1 hour (or up to overnight
    in refrigerator).

5.  Thread marinated chicken onto skewers.

6.  Heat a grill pan over high heat. Cook chicken skewers for about 10
    minutes per side, or until fully cooked through.

7.  For the sauce: In a saucepan, combine reserved marinade and
    mayonnaise, whisking until smooth.

8.  Slowly whisk in butter until melted and sauce is emulsified.

9.  Stir in smoked paprika and garlic powder.

10. Serve chicken skewers drizzled with lemon butter sauce and garnished
    with sliced green onions.
