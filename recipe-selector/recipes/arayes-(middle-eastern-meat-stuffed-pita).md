Oils:

## **Instructions**

1.  Prepare the aromatics:

    -   Grate the onion using a box grater

    -   Place grated onion in a fine-mesh strainer and squeeze out
        excess liquid

    -   Finely mince the jalapeño

    -   Grate the garlic using a microplane

    -   Finely chop the cilantro

2.  Make the filling:

    -   Combine grated onion, minced jalapeño, and grated garlic

    -   Chop mixture together one more time to integrate

    -   In a large bowl, mix chopped aromatics with ground beef

    -   Add paprika, cumin, cardamom, allspice, onion powder, garlic
        powder, salt, and pepper

    -   Mix thoroughly with gloved hands until well combined

3.  Prepare the pitas:

    -   Cut each pita in half

    -   Carefully open the pocket of each half without tearing

4.  Stuff the pitas:

    -   Fill each pita half with meat mixture

    -   Don\'t overfill - leave some room as meat will expand during
        cooking

    -   Gently press to distribute filling evenly inside the pocket

5.  Cook:

    -   Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat

    -   Brush stuffed pitas with olive oil on both sides

    -   Place on hot grill pan

    -   Cook until golden brown with nice grill marks, about 3-4 minutes
        per side

    -   Continue cooking until meat is fully done and pita is crispy

6.  Serve:

    -   Transfer to serving plates

    -   Squeeze fresh lemon juice over top

    -   Serve immediately while hot

Note: Choose thick pita bread that will hold up well during grilling.
The meat should be well-seasoned and juicy, while the pita should be
crispy on the outside.
