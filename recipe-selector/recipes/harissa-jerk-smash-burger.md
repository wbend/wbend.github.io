## **Instructions**

Prepare the Meat:

1.  In a bowl, combine ground beef, harissa paste, and jerk seasoning.

2.  Season with salt.

3.  Using gloved hands, gently mix until just combined. Do not overwork
    the meat.

4.  Divide into 3.5 oz portions using a scale.

5.  Form into loose balls.

Cooking:

1.  Heat a heavy-bottom pan or griddle until very hot (smoking).

2.  Lightly oil the cooking surface.

3.  Place meat balls on the hot surface.

4.  Immediately cover with parchment paper and smash firmly with a
    spatula until thin.

5.  Cook until crust forms (about 2 minutes).

6.  Season with black pepper.

7.  Flip and cook another 1-2 minutes.

Assembly:

1.  Toast brioche buns until golden.

2.  Spread harissa paste on both bun halves.

3.  Layer bottom bun with:

    -   Dill pickles

    -   Smashed burger patty

    -   Slow-grilled onions

4.  Add additional harissa sauce if desired.

5.  Top with bun lid.

Note: The key to this fusion burger is not overworking the meat - just
combine enough to incorporate the seasonings. The harissa and jerk
combination creates a unique North African-Jamaican fusion flavor
profile.
