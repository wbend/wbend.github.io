Fish Marinade:

    cumin, salt, black pepper, and white pepper.

2.  Add fish fillets and coat thoroughly. Marinate for at least 15
    minutes.

Mango Salsa:

1.  Combine diced mango, bell pepper, jalapeño, avocado, and red onion
    in a bowl.

2.  Add 1 tablespoon avocado oil, juice of 1/2 lime, and a pinch of
    salt.

3.  Toss gently to combine. Set aside.

Spicy Mayo Sauce:

1.  In a tall container, combine mayonnaise, Sriracha, peeled garlic
    clove, and juice of 1/2 lime.

2.  Blend with an immersion blender until smooth.

Cooking and Assembly:

1.  Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.

2.  Cook marinated fish for 6-8 minutes, flipping halfway through, until
    fish flakes easily.

3.  Remove fish from pan and break into chunks.

4.  In the same pan with residual oil, briefly warm tortillas on both
    sides.

5.  Assemble tacos: tortilla, fish, mango salsa, and spicy mayo sauce.

6.  Serve with lime wedges on the side.

Note: For best results, prepare the mango salsa while the fish is
marinating to allow flavors to meld.
