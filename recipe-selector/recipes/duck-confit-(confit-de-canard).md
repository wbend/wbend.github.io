Per serving (serves 4): 650 calories

## **Ingredients**

Proteins:

-   4 duck legs

Produce:

-   1 whole head garlic, cloves separated and peeled

-   6 sprigs fresh thyme

-   4 sprigs fresh rosemary

Fats:

-   4-6 cups duck fat (enough to fully submerge legs)

Seasonings:

-   2 tablespoons kosher salt

-   1 teaspoon black pepper

## **Instructions**

1.  The night before cooking, generously coat duck legs with kosher
    salt, using about 1½ teaspoons per leg. Place in a shallow dish,
    cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight (12-24 hours).

2.  Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

3.  Remove duck legs from refrigerator and pat completely dry with paper
    towels.

4.  Season legs lightly with black pepper.

5.  Place legs in a shallow baking dish that fits them snugly in a
    single layer.

6.  Nestle garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and rosemary around the duck
    legs.

7.  Warm duck fat just until liquid, then pour over the legs until they
    are completely submerged.

8.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.

9.  Place in preheated oven and cook for 1 to 1½ hours, or until the
    meat is very tender and pulls away easily from the ankle bone when
    tested with a fork.

10. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, keeping legs
    submerged in fat.

For storage:

1.  Transfer legs to a clean container with a tight-fitting lid.

2.  Strain the cooking fat through a fine-mesh strainer to remove
    aromatics.

3.  Pour the strained fat over the legs, making sure they are completely
    covered.

4.  Seal container and refrigerate. Properly stored confit will keep for
    up to 6 months.

To serve:

1.  Remove desired number of legs from the fat.

2.  Heat in a 350°F (175°C) oven until warmed through, about 15-20
    minutes.

3.  For crispy skin, finish under the broiler for 3-5 minutes.

Note: The used duck fat can be strained, stored in the refrigerator, and
reused for future confits.
