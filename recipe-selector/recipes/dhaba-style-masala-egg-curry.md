## **Instructions**

1.  Place eggs in a pot of cold water. Bring to boil, then reduce heat

3.  Add chopped onion and cook until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.

    down and oil starts to separate, about 8-10 minutes.

    masala, black pepper, salt). Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring
    constantly.

7.  Add water and bring to simmer. Cook for 5 minutes to let flavors
    meld.

8.  Make small cuts on surface of boiled eggs to help them absorb curry.
    Add eggs to the gravy.
