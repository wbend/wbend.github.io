## **Instructions**

1.  Make the marinade:

    -   In a large bowl, combine yogurt, minced garlic, all ground
        spices, vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper

    -   Whisk until well combined

2.  Prepare the chicken:

    -   Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels

    -   Add to marinade and coat thoroughly

    -   Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight

3.  Make the yogurt sauce:

    -   Toast coriander and cumin seeds in a dry pan until fragrant,
        then grind

    -   Combine yogurt, salted grated cucumber (squeezed dry), pureed
        garlic, chopped cilantro, and ground spices

    -   Mix well and refrigerate until needed

4.  Cook the chicken:

    -   Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C)

    -   Remove chicken from marinade and place on a lined baking sheet

    -   Roast for 25-30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and
        edges are crispy

    -   Let rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing

5.  To serve:

    -   Warm the flatbreads

    -   Slice the chicken thinly

    -   Assemble with lettuce, tomatoes, red onion

    -   Top with yogurt sauce and spicy sauce as desired

Note: For best results, let chicken come to room temperature for 30
minutes before cooking. If you have a vertical rotisserie, you can stack
and cook the marinated chicken traditionally.
