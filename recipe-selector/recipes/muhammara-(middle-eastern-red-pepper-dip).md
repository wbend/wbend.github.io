## **Ingredients**

Produce:

-   5 red bell peppers, seeded

-   1 white onion

-   2 Roma tomatoes

-   1 hot chili pepper

-   8 cloves garlic

-   1 bunch fresh parsley

Pantry Items:

-   2 tablespoons tomato paste

-   1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses, plus extra for garnish

-   100g walnuts, chopped and toasted

-   100g pomegranate seeds

Seasonings & Spices:

-   2 teaspoons cumin seeds

-   2 teaspoons coriander seeds

-   Salt, to taste

-   Black pepper, to taste

Oils & Vinegars:

-   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided

## **Instructions**

1.  Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2.  Cut peppers, onion, and tomatoes into large chunks. Toss with 2
    tablespoons olive oil, salt, and black pepper on a baking sheet.

3.  Roast vegetables for 25-30 minutes until slightly blackened.

4.  Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small pan over medium
    heat. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes
    until caramelized.

5.  In a separate dry pan, toast cumin and coriander seeds over medium
    heat for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Grind to a powder using a spice
    grinder or mortar and pestle.

6.  Remove blackened vegetables from the oven. Transfer tomatoes to a
    separate area of the tray or new tray, as they need additional
    cooking time.

7.  Add whole garlic cloves to the baking sheet and return to the oven
    for 15 minutes.

8.  Once cooled slightly, peel and discard the pepper skins.

9.  In a food processor, combine roasted vegetables, caramelized tomato
    paste, ground spices, and pomegranate molasses. Process until
    smooth.

10. Add toasted walnuts and pulse several times until desired
    consistency is reached.

11. Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish with pomegranate seeds,
    reserved chopped walnuts, fresh parsley leaves, and a drizzle of
    pomegranate molasses.

Note: Traditional recipes include breadcrumbs for texture, but this
version achieves the right consistency through thorough vegetable
roasting.
