## **Instructions**

1.  Soak rice and chosen legume separately in cold water for 6-8 hours
    or overnight.

2.  Drain the soaked rice and legumes thoroughly.

3.  For Green Pancakes:

    -   Blend soaked rice, mung beans, ginger, green chilies, cumin
        seeds, and spinach

    -   Add water gradually until you achieve a smooth pancake batter
        consistency

    -   Season with salt to taste

4.  For Yellow Pancakes:

    -   Blend soaked rice, chickpeas, ginger, green chilies, cumin
        seeds, and turmeric

    -   Add water gradually until smooth

    -   Season with salt to taste

        seeds, and Kashmiri chili powder

    -   Add water gradually until smooth

    -   Season with salt to taste

6.  Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat.

7.  Pour about 1/4 cup batter in the center and spread in a circular
    motion to form a thin pancake.

8.  Drizzle oil around the edges and cook for 2-3 minutes until bubbles
    form on top.

Serving suggestions:

-   Roll with spiced mashed potato filling for a wrap

-   Serve with mint chutney

-   Top with gunpowder spice mixed with sesame oil

Note: Batter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The
consistency should be similar to crepe batter - thin enough to spread
but thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
