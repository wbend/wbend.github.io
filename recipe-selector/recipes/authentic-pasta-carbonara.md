# Authentic Pasta Carbonara

Total time: 25 minutes Total calories: 2400 Per serving (serves 4): 600

## **Ingredients**

Proteins:

-   4 egg yolks

-   6 oz guanciale, diced

Pasta:

-   1 pound spaghetti or other long pasta

Dairy:

-   1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese

Seasonings:

-   Fresh black pepper to taste

-   Salt for pasta water

## **Instructions**

1.  Bring a large pot of generously salted water to boil for the pasta.

2.  Place diced guanciale in a cold, heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan.
    Turn heat to medium-low and slowly render the fat, allowing fond
    (browned bits) to develop on the bottom of the pan.

3.  While guanciale renders, cook pasta according to package directions
    until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water before draining.

4.  In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks and grated Pecorino Romano
    cheese until well combined.

5.  When guanciale is crispy, add generous amount of fresh black pepper
    and turn off heat. Allow pan to cool slightly.

6.  Using tongs, transfer the hot pasta directly to the pan with
    guanciale. The residual pasta water will help deglaze the fond from
    the bottom of the pan.

7.  Working quickly, pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta and
    toss continuously to create a creamy sauce. If needed, add small
    amounts of reserved pasta water to achieve desired consistency.

8.  The residual heat will gently cook the eggs while continuous mixing
    prevents them from scrambling.

9.  Serve immediately, topped with additional grated Pecorino Romano and
    black pepper if desired.
