## **Ingredients**

Proteins:

-   2 cups dried white beans

Produce:

-   2 large onions, finely diced

-   2 Turkish green peppers (or 1 green bell pepper), sliced

-   2-3 red chilies, whole

-   4 cloves garlic, minced

Pantry Items:

-   2 tablespoons tomato paste

-   2 tablespoons biber salçası (Turkish red pepper paste)

-   4 cups water (plus more for soaking)

Seasonings:

-   1 tablespoon salt (plus extra for soaking)

-   1 teaspoon black pepper

-   1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)

Oils & Vinegars:

-   1/4 cup olive oil

For Serving:

-   Turkish pilav (rice pilaf)

-   Turkish pickled vegetables

## **Instructions**

1.  Soak white beans overnight (at least 8 hours) in cold water with 1
    tablespoon salt.

2.  Drain and rinse the soaked beans thoroughly.

3.  Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.

4.  Add diced onions and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7
    minutes.

5.  Add tomato paste and biber salçası (red pepper paste). Cook,
    stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes to develop the flavors.

6.  Stir in black pepper and minced garlic, cook for another minute.

7.  Add the drained beans, Turkish green peppers (or bell pepper), whole
    red chilies, and water.

8.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for about
    1-1.5 hours, or until beans are tender.

9.  Add salt and continue cooking uncovered for another 15-20 minutes,
    allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.

10. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.

11. Serve hot with Turkish pilav and pickled vegetables on the side.

Note: If biber salçası is unavailable, you can substitute with
additional tomato paste and a pinch of red pepper flakes, though the
flavor will be slightly different from the traditional version.
