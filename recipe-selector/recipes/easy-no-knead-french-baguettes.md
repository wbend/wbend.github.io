Notes:

-   If room temperature is cold, warm oven to 45째C (113째F), turn off,
    then use for rising

-   Different flours may require slight adjustment to water ratio

-   If dough seems too wet, reduce water slightly

-   Position oven rack based on your oven\'s hot spots for even baking

-   Use conventional (top/bottom) heating, not convection
