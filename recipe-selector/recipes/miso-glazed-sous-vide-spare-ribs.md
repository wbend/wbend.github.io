## **Ingredients**

Proteins:

-   4 pieces spare ribs (approximately 1 lb total)

Pantry Items:

-   Miso paste (3 tablespoons)

-   White rice (2 cups, cooked)

-   Soy sauce (1/4 cup)

-   Mirin (1/4 cup)

-   Apple cider vinegar (2 tablespoons)

-   MSG (1/2 teaspoon)

-   Sugar (2 tablespoons)

Seasonings & Herbs:

-   Cambodian Kampot peppercorns (1 tablespoon, crushed)

-   Garlic powder (1 teaspoon)

-   Sesame seeds (1 tablespoon)

-   Scallions (2-3, sliced)

## **Instructions**

1.  Thoroughly coat spare ribs with miso paste, ensuring even coverage

2.  Place ribs in an airtight container and refrigerate overnight (12-24
    hours)

3.  Remove ribs from refrigerator and place in sous vide bags

4.  Cook sous vide until tender (approximately 6-8 hours at 165°F/74°C)

5.  Reserve the cooking liquid from the bags for glazing

6.  Remove ribs from bags and pat dry

7.  While ribs are drying, prepare glaze by combining reserved bag
    juices with soy sauce, mirin, apple cider vinegar, MSG, and sugar in
    a small saucepan. Simmer until reduced and thickened, about 5-7
    minutes

8.  Place ribs on a rack under the broiler

9.  Brush ribs with glaze 3 times over 5-6 minutes, allowing each layer
    to set

10. Meanwhile, prepare the crumble by mixing crushed Kampot peppercorns
    with garlic powder and sesame seeds

11. Optional: torch the membrane side of the ribs until crispy

12. Serve ribs over white rice

13. Garnish with peppercorn-sesame mixture and sliced scallions

Note: Recipe maintains the membrane on the ribs intentionally, as it
becomes pleasantly crispy when broiled or torched.
