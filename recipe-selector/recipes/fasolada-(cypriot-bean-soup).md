## **Instructions**

1.  In a large pot, combine diced celery, carrots, onion, and minced
    garlic.

2.  Season vegetables with salt and cook over medium heat until
    softened, about 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally.

3.  Add tomato paste and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring to coat
    the vegetables.

4.  Add white beans, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves.

5.  Drop in the whole peeled apple and vegetable bouillon cube.

6.  Add enough water to cover ingredients by about 2 inches
    (approximately 6-8 cups).

7.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 1 hour, until
    soup has thickened and flavors have melded.

8.  Remove herbs and apple before serving.

9.  Serve hot with a generous drizzle of olive oil, crumbled feta
    cheese, and olives on the side.

Note: This traditional Cypriot dish is the national soup of Cyprus. The
apple adds natural sweetness and helps thicken the soup.
