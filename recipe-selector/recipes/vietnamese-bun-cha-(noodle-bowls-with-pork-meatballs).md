## **Ingredients**

Proteins:

-   1 pound ground pork

Produce:

-   2 stalks lemongrass, finely minced

-   4 cloves garlic, divided (2 minced for meatballs, 2 minced for
    sauce)

-   2 medium carrots, julienned

-   1 head butter lettuce, separated into leaves

-   1 cup fresh cilantro leaves

-   1 cup fresh mint leaves

-   2-3 Thai red chilies, thinly sliced (for garnish)

Noodles:

-   1 pound rice vermicelli noodles

Sauce & Seasonings:

-   3 tablespoons fish sauce, divided

-   2 tablespoons oyster sauce

-   1/4 cup lime juice (about 2-3 limes)

-   1/4 cup water

-   3 tablespoons sugar, divided

-   1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Caramel Sauce:

-   2 tablespoons sugar

-   1 tablespoon water

## **Instructions**

1.  Make the caramel sauce: In a small saucepan, combine sugar and
    water. Heat over medium heat without stirring until it turns golden
    brown, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

2.  In a large bowl, combine ground pork, minced lemongrass, 2 cloves
    minced garlic, 2 tablespoons fish sauce, oyster sauce, black pepper,
    and the cooled caramel sauce. Mix well and let marinate for 15-20
    minutes.

3.  Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce (nuoc cham): In a bowl, combine
    1/4 cup lime juice, remaining fish sauce, water, 2 tablespoons
    sugar, remaining minced garlic, and julienned carrots. Whisk until
    sugar dissolves. Set aside.

4.  Cook rice vermicelli according to package instructions. Drain and
    rinse with cold water.

5.  Form the marinated pork mixture into small patties, about 2-3 inches
    in diameter.

6.  Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the pork
    patties for 3-4 minutes per side until nicely browned and cooked
    through.

7.  Once cooked, dip each pork patty briefly in the prepared nuoc cham
    sauce.

8.  To assemble each bowl:

    -   Place a portion of cooked vermicelli noodles at the bottom

    -   Arrange butter lettuce leaves around the sides

    -   Add fresh herbs (cilantro and mint)

    -   Place several pork patties on top

    -   Garnish with sliced red chilies

    -   Serve with extra dipping sauce on the side
