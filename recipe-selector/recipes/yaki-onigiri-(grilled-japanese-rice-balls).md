## **Ingredients**

Rice & Seasonings:

-   2 cups short-grain Japanese white rice

-   2¼ cups water

-   2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar

-   2 tablespoons light soy sauce (for brushing)

-   1 teaspoon togarashi seasoning (optional)

Filling:

-   1 (5 oz) can tuna, drained

-   3 tablespoons Japanese mayonnaise (Kewpie/QP)

## **Instructions**

1.  Rinse rice thoroughly in cold water until water runs clear, about
    3-4 times.

2.  Place rinsed rice in rice cooker and add water until it reaches one
    finger joint (approximately 1 inch) above the rice level.

3.  Cook rice according to rice cooker instructions (approximately 20-25
    minutes).

4.  Once rice is cooked, transfer to a large plate and sprinkle with
    rice wine vinegar.

5.  Spread rice out to help it cool slightly, about 5-10 minutes or
    until comfortable to handle.

6.  In a small bowl, mix drained tuna with Japanese mayonnaise and
    togarashi (if using).

7.  With dampened hands, take about ½ cup of rice and create an
    indentation in the center.

8.  Place about 1 tablespoon of tuna mixture in the center and cover
    with additional rice.

9.  Form into a ball, then shape into a triangle by using one hand as a
    base and the other to create the sides.

10. Heat a large non-stick pan over high heat.

11. Place onigiri in the hot pan and brush the exposed side with soy
    sauce.

12. Cook for 2-3 minutes until crispy, then flip and brush the other
    side with soy sauce.

13. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until both sides are golden brown and
    crispy.
